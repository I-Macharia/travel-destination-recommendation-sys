Tourists visiting Africa often struggle to find suitable travel destinations that align with their preferences, making it challenging to plan a satisfying trip within their budget and time constraints. 

Our main aim as AfricuraAI is to develop a machine learning model i.e. recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations for the best tourist destinations in Africa. By considering customer reviews, budget constraints, specific locations, available amenities, and residence type, the model aims to suggest the ideal tourist destination that aligns with the user's preferences.
