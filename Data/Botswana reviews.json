  "text": "We took the guided tour from Isaac, who was great and gave us lots of information about the various animals currently being looked after. The highlight is of course the friendly honey badger, Badgy. From the minute we stepped in to his house he was up and around our legs wanting fuss and playtime. Isaac was great with him and gave him some good rough and tumble. Badgy also gave us a good demo of his intelligence by operating the door to his private den by himself. Aside from badgy there were lots of injured and sick animals being looked after and it was very interesting to learn about them and how they are being helped. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Kasane. ",

  "text": "The sanctuary does very nice work, rehabilitating injured or orphaned animals/birds/reptiles. I visited the sanctuary by myself and there are two types of visit: the standard or “enhanced” visit ($5 or $7), I opted for the enhanced tour and I really enjoyed it. My personal guide took the time to show me all the animals, explain about the animals’ habitat and history. You can interact with animals like the honey badger and tree squirrel etc. They also do a lot of educational work with the local community and I highly recommend visiting if you like animals and you’re in the area.

  "text": "Very cheap to get into and worth paying a tiny bit more to have the hands on option. We held snakes, chameleon, bush baby and tortoise, saw lots of poisonous snakes, meerkats and birds but the undoubted highlight was the honey badger who kept closing his sliding door as he didn't want to come out. This centre does fantastic work, rescuing animals, eventually releasing them again when and if appropriate and educating the locals and school children about some of the benefits of these animals . It was a pleasure  to support this cause. ",

  "text": "An animal rescue centre where the staff are very caring towards the animals and very keen to tell you about them. It was a rainy day and this filled the time nicely. Bush-babies were cute, honey badger amusing and the eponymous caracal quite aggressive (presumably from previous ill treatment before he arrived). Many snakes and other reptiles in quite cramped vivaria, but at least they had been rescued and were still alive.",

  "text": "I have to admit that we were a bit hesitant about going to this not very well advertised animal sanctuary. It is the only place like it that we came across in three weeks in Botswana but it is SO worth supporting. We were the only group that turned up on the morning that we went and it was great!. Isaac showed us around and we handled several snakes and some other animals. The pookies (bushbabies) were the stars but Isaac's stories kept us interested in all the animals.\nThe centre has at least one research project with an American university (mongoose-related as I recall), but the big educational issue is with schools, where it works to dispel the local myths, especially about creatures of the night. So many groups are too politically correct to explain what the locals believe so it was refreshing to get an idea of why chameleons were particularly feared as harbingers of death - and even better to handle one!\nThis place needs to be supported - so I thoroughly recommend it for that reason alone - but nowhere else comes close to providing such a hands on experience!",

  "text": "We spent a week in Kasane and honestly this place was a highlight. Seeing the smaller animals up close and personal and supporting an institution that is caring for these animals was a privilege. Sure it’s not super clean and comfortable and sometimes some animals have been released, but you get a great insight into the hard work that is involved in conservation. Plus there’s bush babies. They’re the best.",

  "text": "This is a working centre and educates children and adults about local wildlife, people have the wrong idea on snakes, yes caution and knowledge is needed. Our guide had to leave us couple of times to with a couple of school trips, but left us with snakes, we have a little knowledge and know how to handle them. My wife went into teacher mode when children wouldn't come near and squealed, and she got some children to touch them and lose the fear. There are a lot of local snakes you wouldn't go near so the children need to know what to do.\nThere are injured animals and birds some can be release when well some can't.They came down to our hotel to remove a puff adder from the grounds and release it in the bush. Some wander around the place such as the one winged Marabou Stork\nThis is not a pretty place it is a working centre, please help them by putting some money in their donations box, they are doing a good job.",

It is a bit like a small zoo, but the animals are only there because they have been rescued either from accidents or from places where they are not wanted, such as poisonous snakes in hotels. Any that can be released back into the wild are rehabilitated. Our guide was charming and informative, and local. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and learnt a lot. The cost is very low and well worth it.",

There were many snakes, that I was curious to see (as it was winter when I was there there weren't many active snakes. There were also bush babies, that i had seen their eyes at night jumping through the trees, but had not seen them up close. There were also a pair of scops owls. These I had also heard in a tree above our campsite in Kruger, but not actually seen. The guide was very informative.",

  "text": "No Aardvark on display, no touching of bush babies, not a any craft activity by a woman of African heritage.  In fact, not a single African woman even spotted.  The photos on their Facebook Page is deceiving too.  Upon arrival we were approached by a very rude,  American lady who was clearly involved in running this business, telling us that it's cheap \"only P60\".  She then left us in the hands of a guide who was very kind and embarrassed by her rudeness.  In short, you pay P60 to see snakes in small boxes and a handful of animals in small cages.  This American employee stated very clearly that the bushbabies are not to be touched or held, basically the box was opened and closed.  The Aardvark was not even seen or displayed, and the baboon was not even mentioned. You are allowed to hold the python, but you can hold a python in many places in the world.  P60 to hold a snake was outrageous.  Give this place a skip, spend your P60 in Chobe National Park for a whole day in the park, see loads of animals you will never see in another park, but animals in cages can be seen in any zoo. In short this is a tourist trap.  Last but not the least, after paying P60, we found a box at their exit asking of additional donations.  They also promote themselves as a \"Womens Centre\".   No sign a single woman of African heritage...just another trap.",

  "text": "This biodiversity centre is still a small setup in Kasane, nothing huge, but really worth the stop. We also heard from friends to check it out and we al loved it. The biodiversity centre has two major attractions and a baby baboon.. but I'm afraid that baby baboon will be getting very big soon, so it won't be around for ever. \nThe other two major attractions we found extremely interesting to see, feel and photography up close are the snakes, where you also get every good and detailed explanation from the guide and ... the stars of the centre.. Bush Babies! \nA bush-baby must be the cutest animal alive in the African outdoors, but they are very difficult to spot in the wild. Mostly they come out at night and then you only see their huge eyes reflect in your spotlight. \nThis was for all of us, the very first time we could clearly see and hold a bushbaby and they are very cool... photos are attached :)",

  "text": "We spent an afternoon there and had great fun. the guides are clearly passionate about where they work and the Center certeinaly does everything it can to help with Conservation. a lot of the animals here are from people being caught trying to smuggle them across borders, or being injured by cars. For someone such as myself who enjoys wildlife and the bush, I absolutely loved it. highlight was definitely the bush baby, getting up close to an aardvark and the baby baboon who just wonders around following the guides. Definitely worth a visit.",

Our tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly but the other staff not so. A good cause, rescue injured animals as well as illegally smuggled animals. We have been in Kasane three times and wouldn't have found the place but for a tip from a local. Worth a visit",

We were entertained by a cute little baby baboon called Miley who played with the kids all morning while we toured the centre. There are lots of interesting animals to see and the guide was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. Definitely worth taking the extended tour so you can hold the reptiles and cuddle the impossibly cute bush babies! ",

Those that remain are used, to educate local children. And as a tourist attraction. But still, they do really good work nd it is a fascinating place to visit. Where else can you see a pangolin up close? I was skeptical, but enjoyed it. Great place for children I should think.",

Well worth a trip to see the great work they have already put in place. Now needs more support to upgrade the foundations into more sturdy and permanent inhabitants for the animals they take in. We held 2 snakes, a chameleon and saw an aardvark they were rehabilitating having been attacked by dogs. Thank you for all your great, keep it up! ",

  "text": "Entry charge to \"Chobe Crocodile Farm\"  was 100 Pulas and a employee guided me inside the farm that had many dogs which included a Dachshund and a Mastiff.\nThe employee took me to a large hallway having  Circular fish tank wells that contained crocodiles. . Was introduced to Ms  Pedzani,the caretaker and employee of this crocodile farm.She explained me the different crocodiles in different waterless tanks.One tank had only baby crocodiles which were 4 years old.\" Moremi\" who is supposed to be over 100 years old is the prized breeding crocodile of this farm.The next crocodile of importance  \" Mr Big Boy\"  is the second oldest crocodile on the farm at supposedly 90 years of age. She feeds each large crocodile about 15 chickens once in three months.This particular hall exhibit of  the crocodiles was used for student and tourist tours and hence illustrations on the walls explaining the life facts of the crocodile. I was next taken to  the outdoors breeding pond enclosures which had numerous crocodiles including females guarding their eggs buried in sand.The females guarding the eggs are very protective and aggressive and one female close to the fence almost charged at me when I went too close. Ms Pedzani told me to keep my distance from the female crocodile as they can also leap a few feet and grab their  prey as seen in wildlife documentaries which in this present situation  could be my limb.She showed me the two different enclosures in which \" Mr Big Boy\" and \" Moremi\" were kept and finally while  departing met the owner, a white Botswanan  citizen Ms Sue.Slogrove who explained me her farm and the crocodile industry in Africa which is big commercial business. Her prized and most famous crocodile on her farm was \" Nelson\" who lived over 100 years of age expiring in 2004  and was also pictured on the stamp of Botswana.",

These kind of initiatives are really  effected by the covid restriction and are suffering to keep on  going the good work. We could even hold young crocodiles (1 year old) carefully (watch their teeth!!!! When could you ever hold a croc in your hands???? Amazing story about their sensitivity for movements: they know who/how many are coming out of the car; who is the weakest, who pregnant, how many steps etc. Don't miss this experience!",

  "text": "Having travelled over a very narrow timber bridge we entered the Moremi Wildlife Reserve. \n\nThe roads were quite rough in places and on a couple of occasions we bounced so hard we hit out heads on the rough of the vehicle as the potholes were deeper than expected, but it was so much fun.\n\nHere we saw wild dog, hyenas - including their cubs, elephants and lions as well as giraffe, and plenty of birds.\n\nAfter spending a couple of hours in the park we made our way back to our accommodation as you had to be out of the park by dark.\n\nYou can camp in Moremi, there are places to pitch your tent, cook a meal and have a shower but you need to be mindful of the wildlife around you.\n\nBeautiful scenery and worth a visit.",

  "text": "Moremi has been absolutely battered since our last visit. Previously, across much of the area the bush was thick and right to the track edge. This is now very uncommon, the lack of water and especially elephant damage to the trees has resulted in a much more open landscape. Not really an improvement but we still managed to see many animals. Highlights were a honey badger, distant rhino, and an absolute multitude of birds. Sadly, we didn’t see lion here. Last time we spent a fabulous morning watching three lion at very close quarters.\n\nMoremi is also busier than we remembered it. Many vehicles seem to come from Maun on a daily basis, and many are in poor repair. They also thrash around the place trying to maximise viewing opportunities without much thought to the animals welfare. It is high time the park limited numbers.\n\nDriving in the area isn’t difficult but you absolutely must stay on the tracks. Also, slow is good, and increases your chances of animal encounters. If and when you do spot something don’t be surprised to see other vehicles come to see what you are looking at. Also, some of the guides have taken to telling others that there is a “five minute rule”. They expect you to move on so that they can claim a better viewing angle. There isn’t. Tell them to shove it! \n\nMoremi is an enchanting place, we have been to Ngorongoro and I would rate the two similarly. There are wildlife encounters around every corner and the bird life is exceptional. However, it is changing. Getting busier, reduced bush cover and (September 2019) very dry. Perhaps a good idea to go soon before mankind does his usual trick and ruins it.\n\nWould we go back. Yup, we like the area, especially as we have now broken our Leopard duck with a great two cat sighting close to Fourth Bridge. However, in view of my previous comments about human intrusion, we probably wont.",

Furthermore we found that the ablution facilities are not kept as clean and well maintained at the entrance gates,  as what one would expect for an important tourist attraction such as this.  The prices charged for camping sites, due to the Park fees, Vehicle fees and bed levies;  is rather high considering what you receive in return with facilities being neglected.",

  "text": "This September I was lucky enough to experience 5 days and 4 nights in the oldest protected section of the Okavango Delta, the Moremi Wildlife Reserve, Botswana. We were taken care of by the Capture Africa Luxury Safaris Team, with the added bonus of  having the owners, Brian and Hildrene Gibson right beside us on our safari. The Capture Africa Team have been operating since 1997, and over this time have developed an extraordinary team of heads, hearts and hands that know this part of the African continent like no other, and are proud to share it with all those who love simple luxury in the wilderness.\n\nWe were collected from Maun Airport, an immaculate Safari Vehicle awaiting our arrival. It was stocked with Ice cold refreshments and warm Ponchos for the dusty/windy Botswana Roads that lead us from Maun to the Delta. This gave us our first taste of the bush, as Elephants clambered through the woodlands, a herd of Buffalo crossing the road ahead, Giraffe ambling passed Baobab trees and Warthog digging in the dirt. \n\nWe arrived at sunset, to Tswana voices singing a welcome song and our camp drenched in golden light, camouflage tents, nestled along a quiet section of the river in the heart of the Moremi Reserve. Warm, friendly greetings and campsite tours followed by an ice cold G&T by the fire overlooking the idyllic river with Openbill Storks preening themselves in the sunlight. Open-mouthed and pinching oneself.\n\nCapture Africa have created the most extraordinary Luxury Camping Safari experience, the small, thoughtful gestures evident everywhere. From the delicious quality meals prepared with care, campfire rituals, the fully-equipped, comfort tents, African-style shower under the stars, and the friendly staff with limitless capacity to ensure your experience is memorable. Late evenings spent around the campfire sharing stories and listening, to the sounds of the wild; lions roaring, Hippos grunting and the eerie night calls of hidden owls. To drift off to sleep with these sounds in the background is both enlivening and strangely, familiar as the presence of these sentient, primal beings accompanies you into the night. \n\nThe quiet mornings come with a beauty of their own, especially the sunrise safari . I know a fair amount of the wildlife species, having grown up in South Africa, but having them identified by an expert, and seeing them up-close-and-personal is incomparable to “armchair travel”. Led by Brian Gibson, a professional conservation guide & naturalist, we tracked, spotted and learnt another language over the 5 days, the language of the Wild. He shared insights, observations and stories from his decades of experience, and on our final days safari was able to track one of the most endangered mammals in Africa, the rare African Wild Dog. We sat inn awe watching the pack, having just made a kill, frolicking and playing in the veld oblivious to our stares and whispers from across the river. The birdlife was mesmerising, hours spent behind the binos, in silence, watching, and then comparing notes about all we’d seen over a hot cup of coffee and rusks in a Mopane woodland, under an Acacia, or on a fairytale-like section of the Khwai river. Pure, morning magic!\n\nI will make my way back to the Okavango in this lifetime . Thoughts disappear, the heart beats louder and the wilderness creeps under the skin and into the soul like it’s home. This Luxury Tented Safari, is an enlivening way to capture Africa. Ke a leboga!\n\n#Captureafrica #Okavangodelta #Moremigamereserve #Botswana #Khwai",

A good bit of research into this area before you visit is a good idea and take careful note of the season that you travel in especially if you are doing self drive as the road network can be challenging in high water or in the rainy season.",

  "text": "We travelled to Botswana with Jenman African Safaris, booked via Bench Africa, and visited several national parks/reserves in the Okavango Delta region and nearby. Moremi was easily the most rewarding of these. \n\nWe made two day trips into the Reserve, one around the Khwai River and the other near the North Gate. The wildlife was just amazing -- we were exceptionally fortunate and saw lions (twice, including a kill), a leopard, wildebeest, elephants, hippos, giraffes, zebras, a variety of antelopes, crocodiles, so many different birds ... it really was like being in the middle of a David Attenborough documentary!\n\nThere's a bit of driving involved from wherever you camp on the southern side of the reserve, and an early start in winter can be pretty cold, but the rewards are well worth it!",

Seeing the wildlife was awesome, but meeting the people of Botswana was just as wonderful.\n\nThank you to everyone at Camp Moremi but especially to Wise",

Most impressive was a herd of well over 100 elephants, standing in 3 lines, waiting to follow one another to water; it looked like the queue for Fenway Park.  Twice we observed a pride of lions, once drowsing, once right after a kill.  The Mokoro journey was wonderful, with many birds, and tiny multicolored frogs.",

  "text": "One of the first things we saw here was an Impala up a tree. Of course it didn't climb the tree but was left there by a leopard. So we were checked in, relaxed and had our first game drive back to the same tree. Sure enough we saw our first ever leopard here. Then the second. Then the third. It was a mother and two sub adults. What could be better? So imagine our astonishment when an adult male came out of the bushes and joined them! A complete family group of  four. We spoke to Matto Barfuss who was also there. He spends six months of every year in the bush and hasn't seen that for ten years. What a privilege. Of course we saw much more in our three days. Wild dogs were an obvious highlight. And three young male lions relaxing together, one of which walked past the jeep so close I could have touched him. Food and service here was first class, as were the guides. Ask the guide about the Savute Channel, its an interesting fact.",

If each party pays USD10 and we will keep this secret and drive you off track to see the lions\". We said NO but the driver still drove us off track to see the lion.

Savuti marsh / end of savuti channel (which is bone dry again after 10 years flow), less roads, not many animals. Marsh road versus ridge road: Marsh - if driveable way better. Area around baobab forest / goha hills: away from the crowds - you might see roan. Lynyanti: at least some water, more animals, but difficult road (deep sand) from savuti. If you have not much time I recommend to spend either on the Chobe water front or in the Khwai area.",

  "text": "October is a great time to go when everything is still dried up because you can easily spot the animals. We saw so many animals here. It is a huge area and we did have a safari guide. We even saw wild dogs and a hippo out of the water! Two things we missed in South Africa near Kruger. We flew out and the landing strip at Savuti International airport is just that - a strip of land in the middle of nowhere. This area is not easy to reach - we spent two hours driving on a very sandy \"road\" to get here. We loved how remote this place is. And it was very hot in October - 100+ degrees Fahrenheit.",

The drivers are all connected no matter which lodge they are from, so when something special is found it is quickly passed around. Saying that it was never crowded. The most vehicles we saw was, I think 7. \nThe park has a few rules, the most important one is after 6:30pm all lodge guests are out of the parks and the local people know that after that time armed rangers go in to protect the wildlife. \nBotswana is away ahead of most of the world in recognising that their wildlife is all important and they will protect them any way they can. I for one salute them. The national parks are situated where they are needed ie on migration routes. \nGo and support Botswana and see amazing sights. Nothing is promised because this is a natural habitat but you could see some amazing sights. We did",

  "text": "We enjoyed our stay at Savute Camp. It is so lovely to be so close to the animals. Listening to the lions roars at night were a highlight. We were only disappointed not to have a campsite near the ablution block. The office told us that they were fully booked and that was not the case at all. Lots of empty campsites (as well as next to the ablution block). Think they must get their paperwork in order!!!",

Loads of elephants, water buffalo and antelopes.  Then to Nogatssa where the animals came to us - we sat on out porch and watched them drink.  We could hear them at night as they walked by our tents.  Instead of looking for cars as we walked back to the main lodge we needed to keep out eyes open for elephants and buffalo.  What an experience",

  "text": "We ended our safari in Chobe.  After Savute, it was great to see the Chobe River and a ton of wildlife.  It was like a 1000 Noah's Arks had emptied out by the river (Namibia is on the other side).  Seeing the happy animals play in/near the water was great.  Seeing the lionesses and their cubs crossing from the open areas into the bushes was spectacular.  However, being present while a truckload of Namibian farmers with their guns chased two lions (and then hearing a series of 7-10 shots)...that was traumatic and it still gets my blood pressure up even though I waited three weeks to write this.  I looked away when I realized what was happening.  But there were at least a half dozen other safari cars next to us on the Botswana side of the river witnessing what was happening.  It was horrible.  Our guide later mentioned it to three \"anti-poaching police\"...one female officer said, \"they can do whatever they want.\"  Hmmm...I'm very anti-Trump, but perhaps the idea of building a wall isn't so crazy after all.  Espcially since the lions will go where there is food and not be aware that it's unsafe on the Namibian side of the river.  I hope that the Namibian government aides their farmers in building better fences/protection around the livestock instead of making it ok to shoot lions.  I will never return to Chobe again because it's simply too damn close to Namibia.  I pray every day that no more lions die at the hands of man.",

I would have liked to have taken multiple routes, but at seams at this part of the park, the entry people determine what route you will take, rather than letting the guide follow the tracks and do their thing. We saw plenty of wildlife though; elephants, hippos, giraffes, zebra, impala, judu, jackal, honey badger (in the morning), brown hyena (not often seen), plenty of birds. The only thing we didn't get to see were cats, though we did see cat tracks.",

  "text": "It was my dream once to visit that remote area of Chobe NP. We were staying in Ghoha Hills lodge and took off early in the morning to Ghoha Gates where we turned to the right and drove along the park boundary (excellent road). Then we drove into the park (there are no fences) where Nxunxutsla Pan is. It took us 45 minutes up to there. The road disappeared a bit but one needs to turn left and it is seen again. We joined the main road along the Ngwezumba river.\nThe riverbed scenery is beautiful: red sand gorges, blue water and big trees along the river. Excellent habitat for leopards. \nSometimes the road was washed away and the slope of the river bank in combination with holes demanded a big courage of the driver. The landscape was changed and there were water holes with a few shy animals who didn’t manage to escape from a car: there were no Toyota tracks on the road but only animal tracks. The animals are not used to vehicles there. \nWe entered a wonderful Mopane woodland where we got a flat tire and stopped in the shadow of a big trees. I step out of the car and turned to be a ward during the wheel was changed: I was watching in all directions and listening. There were so many tracks of cats … some of them were petrified in the sand after the last rains. All those messages said: it is our place! And I felt like many eyes were watching me. I would not go through that woodland by feet even during the day light.\nAfter woodland we got to Nogatsaa. There are a few waterholes there and some of them have wooden platforms. The platforms are obviously from 1960th or 70th and are broken down. We stopped by one and sat into the shadow with a cup of Italian espresso (from Hand Presso Machine) as two the rangers arrived. \nThey introduced themselves and looked into our papers. It was obviously that they don’t have too much opportunities to chat because the visitors are sparse in Nogatsaa. They told us about a pack of wild dogs who killed Kudu a day before on that same waterhole and that the lions roaring every day. “You need to come in September! There are a plenty of animals here! And look we are repairing the waterholes and started to repair platforms for you, guys!”, they said. It was a very nice meeting, indeed. Friendly people from Poha Gate.\nThe most beautiful pan was Kwikamba Pan. The place was wide and open with some single trees. The breeding herd of elephants were grazing in the distance. Some birds were sitting close to the water. The colour of the grass changed from fresh green to dark brown making the pan very colourful. We drove around but elephants saw the vehicle and run away. \nWe visited a few other waterholes. By one there was a military camp. The waterholes had beautiful scenery but the animals are not used to cars and are shy. According to the tracks there are a lot of animals in the area. \nThe management of Ghoha Hills lodge can provide you an information about building a new lodge in Nogatsaa. At the moment it is not possible to stay there overnight because there no camping places or some other accommodation. Ghoha Hills owners/managers are going to build a lodge in vicinity of Kwikamba Pan which is supposed to start the operation next year (about May 2016) You can get more information from Abram, the manager of Ghoha Hills. The work must be done to get used animals to vehicles but after one-two years the area will be a hit because there are a lot of predators and zebra migration from Nxai Pan NP to Chobe river is going also through that area. If all platforms will be fixed they will provide an attractive hides for nature lovers. Wilderness pure! \nIt took us about 4 hours to Nogatsaa from Ghoha Gate. \nThere was high grass in some parts of the road - attention must be payed on radiator! We drove further to Chobe river front. The last 20km is a very deep sand and needs a good momentum! Before we got to the tar road we came to a waterhole where a breeding herd of elephants drunk in the orange colour of sunset. It was a very nice trip to Nogatsaa.",

  "text": "We've been living in Gaborone for several months. And one thing I miss the most is the sight of the water. Finally, I found it! The last part of road to the club is very picturesque and once we arrived we could not believe our eyes: water all around surrounded by hills, no city in the sight. We wished to have lunch. First, we were a bit set off by the menu including mostly burgers. We were even more set off by cappuccino that was made of powder. But the burgers - nice! In fact, the best I've had in Gaborone. \n\nI highly recommend the place to spend a sunny lazy afternoon enjoying nice views, a burger and a glass of beer or wine.",

  "text": "A group of us decided to go to the area next to the Yacht Club to see the dam. The hotel arranged for local drivers who stayed with us for the whole trip.\nArriving at the entrance there is security who requested a permit. I noticed a sign saying it was 5BP for each person. The driver suggested a permit could be obtained for a small donation - so 20BP later all of us were allowed in.\nThe road to the club had recently been flooded, but was now passable. We stopped at a number of places on the road.\nThe air was fresh and there was a good range of birds to watch. The scenery was really pleasant.\nWe stayed until sunset. The additional security at the Yacht Club meant we didn't enter.\nWell worth a visit",

  "text": "If you visit Gaborone, you must see the Gaborone Dam from the Yacht club. Check the opening times as they are not always open. The dam was only 4% full on our arrival in February 2016, but after the heavy rains in December 2016 the dam was over 100% full, the water was falling over the concrete walls and even parts of Tlokweng were under water. Now you can visit the Yacht club, but you have to get on a boat to get to the club. The place is great for sundowners, but don't eat here. It will take ages for the food to be prepared and it is awful. The kitchen is just not equipped or staffed to manage large groups and food. Just go for drinks to watch the sunset over the dam and the mountains and have a nice meal in town.",

  "text": "We went sightseeing at the western entrance and it is beautiful at sunset, with clouds and lightning in the southern sky. The gate staff were very friendly and helpful; they advised that the dam is safe to stay over at and there are impala, warthog and other wildlife at the dam. I will definitely visit the dam again and come try my hand at fishing for the tilapia/bream, carp and barbel that are present in the dam. Hopefully the rains will come soon and fill up the dam. Even though it is very empty, it is still a large expanse of water and a sight to behold, especially with a high quality camera.",

Not for visitors as trying to organise the necessary permits to get into this area is extremely difficult and time consuming.

Fishing is not allowed.   Peaceful.  This area could be a jewel for locals and visitors and one of the highlights of a city lacking welcoming safe outdoor space. ",

There is only one semi-open restaurant, Yacht Club (very attractive name for the landlocked country). There are ruins of the former amusement park City-Scape, but not nice to see today. Very good spot for fishing, if you do not have any other need or wish. All in all - good to know that is there, but not enough good to be recommended.",

Usually members only , but on Wednesday and Friday evenings  guests may sign in for the sake of a small parking fee. Thereafter  reasonably priced drinks and bar food but the main attraction is the glorious view across the reservoir ( you may be lucky to actually see water !) especially at sunset when the cooling breeze after a scorching day makes it one of the best places in town  for a sundowner .",

I have not been there but just wanted to say it all depends of what time of the year you go! I know for a fact the dam has very little water at the moment and therefore all the water shortages in Gabs. So ask before you go about waterlevel! But have heard it is a very nice place to go when there is water!!!!",

  "text": "Across the road from Main Mall, on Khama Crescent, you’ll find the Three Dikgosi Monument - a trio of 5.5 m (18 ft) tall bronze sculptures depicting three chiefs: Khama III of the Bangwato, Sebele I of the Bakwena, and Bathoen I of the Bangwaketse.\n\nThese 3 Dikgosi reigned in colonial Botswana (then known as  Bechuanaland) and played a significant role in the country’s history. Had they not travelled to England in 1895 to plead with Queen Victoria and Joseph Chamberlain (the then Secretary of State for the Colonies) to separate the Bechuanaland Protectorate from Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company, Botswana may not have gained its independence.\n\nThe monument is quite inspiring and is definitely one of the places to go to visit in Gabarones' CBD.",

  "text": "This was a stop that was part of a tour of downtown Gaborone. The monument is impressive, beautiful setting, but what is most impressive is learning about the recent (200 yrs) history of the country, from one of the monument's local, very knowledgeable, guides. This is a good place to get a feeling for why Botswana is such a unique country. The guide's comments were complemented by our tour guide Andy, from heritage adventures tours, both rendering our visit memorable. I would have liked to stay longer and learn more (we stayed for about 40 min). This was a hot day, and umbrellas are recommended.",

The staff is always sweet (bring your I.D). Locating the animals is always so easy though at times the Rhinos and Giraffes are difficult to find 🤦. But overall the drive around the sanctuary seeing all the animals is super refreshing.\n\nI've spent a night in one of their A-line chalets before. The rooms were clean, I wasn't really impressed with the cleanliness of the floor of the outdoor shower, the toilet was sorta okay.\n\nAs for the toilets in the sanctuary itself for public use during drives, they are not really well monitored but they are okay-ish.",

  "text": "Enjoyed the self game drive, although the morning was hot we easily spotted animals seeking shelter from the sun in some shady tree areas. We were fortunate to spot an abundance of Rhino as well as Zebra, Giraffe, Impala, Waterbuck and various BirdLife. You need an AWD or 4X4 to self drive the sandy roads or book a drive with a guide at reception area.  Ring your ID as they will need it to make copies when registering you. Only thing we spotted that needed attention was the Toilets! Urinals we’re flooded and so was the wash basin. Hopefully that gets sorted out quick.",

  "text": "the Sanctuary is not one of the top attractions in Botswana,  All is about the Okavango....yet it is worth going to. There is a little gift shops where good stuff costs 1/2 than in Gaborone. And the guides are knowledgeable and clearly familiar with the habits of the animals.\nThe rhinos are superb and...a bit scary...what if they don't like us? They are big!!!!But they look at you through those small eyes...judge you are not a threat and go back to lie down under the shade of a tree. One can take loads of photos of these big, white creatures. Then there are smaller ones, antelopes, with their swirling horns, and the tall necked giraffes, who look a bit scared...even though they should be accustomed to the inquisitive eyes of people. There is plenty of time to look at the wildlife. What one does not see here is elephant and hippos...but elephants may cross the road at any time in Botswana and hippos are in the Okavango delta. Rhinos are a bit different, with that big heavy head...I wondered about what they think.\nWE spent much time simply staring at a rhino family. And as much as I love penguins, I realized that there is something unique in this part of Africa. There are mysterious animals and there is the connection to the ancestral world whence humans came out from",

  "text": "After a mix-up in our 3-night reservation for a 2-bedroomed cottage (caused by our Botswana travel agent not by the Park officials) we were accommodated in a chalet normally used by teachers at a facility for wildlife education. This accommodation was very basic but we were most grateful as the park was overflowing with visitors.\n\nAbsolutely wonderful sightings of various animals and birds, including 26 white and 1 black rhino on our last afternoon! We were surprised at the size of the park, and it was reassuring to note the presence of many armed army personnel within and on the borders of the reserve protecting its assets.\n\nDefinitely a place to be revisited!",

The chalet was old and badly maintained and we had small insects falling onto our bed from the grass roof during the night.\n\nThe staff allowed a group of campers to have a loud party and play music in the camp site until late in the evening. We were unable to  listen to any of the night sounds in the bush.\n\nBased on our experience we definitely won’t visit the park again, which is a real pity because it is the only sanctuary for rhinos in Botswana.",

  "text": "We stayed at the Rhino Sanctuary for two nights en route to Kubu Island.  There is a lot of game in this reserve - well worth driving around, especially to the various pans.  We really enjoyed this aspect of the reserve.  \n\nThe accommodation in the chalets is extremely basic, it consists of beds, a small bathroom and a table.  The upper part of the walls on the A frame is made of netting, so one is unable to \"close\" this area up.  This resulted in all of us being absolutely freezing during the night.\n\nWe ate at the restaurant and found the food to be satisfactory, although somewhat excessively priced.  The service was also very slow due to what seemed like minimal staff.  We assumed this was as a result of Covid.",

  "text": "We stayed at the A-Frame chalet, on our arrival the state of the chalet was shockingly dirty, as we had booked in advance, we were surprised to find the chalet was filthy, downstairs bedding was covered in a layer of dirt, a canvas strip that was put to close a gap above the door had come out and was hanging which i'm guessing added to the dirt on the bed.  Upstairs loft sheets were covered in bird s%$t and again very dirty, credit to the lady at the reception who was very apologetic and since it was already late in the afternoon she arranged alternate accommodation for the night with the promise that the next day it would be cleaned.  You do hear the cars passing on the main road so if this is not your thing i would suggest booking the other chalets or campsites.\n\nChalet C & D were clean and comfortable but could do with some TLC, nice shaded braai areas surrounding the chalets.  The following morning the staff did come through and did a thorough clean and changed all linen.  Again A-Frame chalet could do with maintenance, the canvas entrance to the loft needs to be replaced, torn in places and zipper doesn't close.  Mosquito repellent is strongly suggested for the loft.\n\nApart from the chalet issue we had a fantastic time, plenty of animals to see and very relaxing. We would definitely take the camping route next time round as there were some really nice looking campsites with big shady trees.  Carried our own food so can't comment on the restaurant apart from that it opened at 8am and closed at 5pm which is probably due to the current curfew.  \n\nStaff were friendly and welcoming.",

  "text": "Definitely need a 4x4 to enjoy this place and make the most of it. We really enjoyed seeing the rhino, and the bird hide over the waterhole was amazing. Lots of wildlife and birds here so worth being able to spend a good few hours - we spent an afternoon and then an early morning here but could easily have spent another night. \nCampsites were allocated and very big and well spaced from each other with some shade. Came with own tap and brai. \nAblutions were ok, reasonably clean, warm showers and the lights come on early evening until the morning. Open ablutions so quite a few bugs about.\nUnfenced but nothing scary coming into camp so we enjoyed seeing bushbaby in tree next to the brai and dikdik coming to drink at the tap.\nStaff aren’t very friendly.",

It was an exciting experience and a privilege to see white rhino on foot at close quarters.\n\nBut the reception lady was rude, unhelpful and uninterested and the guide not well informed. The ablutions were not clean and full of mosquitos.  The hot water geyser was turned off, which is ok, but a sign to warn users to turn it on would help. The shower heads were blocked with deposit. A sign to ask users to turn off lights is needed to prevent insects from invading the ablution rooms overnight. \n\nThe campsites are spacious and well-spaces with abundant welcome shade and water points.",

  "text": "Khama Rhino Sanctuary does not disappoint on the animal front, especially around the pans that you can visit driving around their reserve. We stayed for two nights and saw multitudes of springbok, steenbok,= and impala as well as some ostriches, zebra, gemsbok/oryx, a lone giraffe, and -of course- rhinos. The bird spotting here is also worthwhile. We had a great time especially as the sanctuary was very quiet over the weekdays that we camped. The campsites are clean and spacious. The restaurant has a pool and free wifi but limited meal options. The staff weren't particularly enthusiastic either but if you're just wanting to visit to spot some cool animals then you have come to the right place.",

  "text": "We had a great tour with one of the wardens from the sanctuary. He drove us round and told us about the animals and birds that we were seeing, he was very knowledgeable. We saw 8 white rhino, sadly the black rhino were hiding that day.  We also saw giraffe, zebra, warthogs and antelope and lots of birds.\nThe only problem is the Sanctuary is difficult to get to if you are not driving.  Eventually a member fo staff from our hotel drove us out and collected us after the game drive (for a fee).",

  "text": "As a couple we were put in the A frame at the start of our holiday.  We were a family of four the last time we were put in the A frame 18 moths ago.  Couldn’t believe we were booked in there as a couple - the A frame has 2 double beds downstairs and a loft upstairs.  The toilet facilities are outside where white ants have done justice to the thin poles creating a barrier of privacy.  \nThe concerns from 18 months ago remain unattended to still.\nWhite ants are eating away at the mirror frame - this place is derelict.\nIf you are running a fridge there is no electricity. \nYou have to go out side for toilet needs\nThe water is a mere trickle from the shower - same concern 18 moths ago.\nWe were convinced our original accommodation had been swapped out with someone else with the same concerns - no need for a couple to be put here either. The office were not able to help us saying it was pre booked by our agent.\nOn our return and complaints to our booking agent we were in accommodation better suited to our needs - and yes electricity to run the fridge.\n\n",

  "text": "I decided to visit here, mainly to see the birds.  It is a small park,  4,300 hectares, but has an abundance of animals and birds.  You can join a tour, hire a guide or drive yourself.  I opted to drive myself, as I wanted to spend lots of time just watching birds and this seemed the best way to do it.  You must have a 4x4 vehicle and be prepared to scratch the doors!  The roads were great, sandy and sometimes quite deeply rutted but very well signposted and easy to follow.  There is a map available for purchase which is definitely worth getting.  The map is clear and well laid out and there is lots of information on the reverse including checklists for birds, animals and trees.  The best part for me, was the Bird Hide.  A fantastic way to see birds and animals visiting the water hole, without disturbing them.  Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  There is a campground and chalets available, as well as a restaurant but I did‘t use those facilities.  A real gem of a place that I would love to spend another day at.",

  "text": "Khama Rhino Sanctuary was our last stop of our amazing 2 week Botswana Safari. We stayed at Camp C. It was huge and there was lots of space for our 3 caravans. The ablution was about 50m away - this needs some attention as most of the lights need replacement. The pan is about 8km away and we saw 7 rhinos. We drove to 3 different view points and expected to see a few more rhinos since this is a sanctuary. We did however see many small bucks. We decided to go for dinner at the club house restaurant. The food was good however prepare yourself for long wait. ",

  "text": "This was my second time visiting the Khama Rhino Sanctuary and I enjoyed it even more than the last time. We saw 6 rhinos and had lots of time to observe as they were feeding and drinking and there was a young one. As well as Rhinos, there are many birds and animals including giraffes, zebras, warthogs, etc. You never know what will be around the next bend. We were not able to stay in the main lodge but they put us in the overflow cabins that were very comfortable and secluded. The morning was magical with all sorts of birds and impalas. This is a nice stopping point between Gaborone and Kasane.\n",

  "text": "After spending three idyllic weeks of camping in Botswana, we were looking forward to our stay at Khama Rhino Sanctuary. Needless to say, we have a  4x4 fully rigged for comfortable camping, so this chalet had to be a step up from that, especially at the price!\nWhat we got, was a chalet with no electricity, no hot water, no fridge and one dim oil lamp for two bedrooms of which the one was on the top floor. \nThe shower consisted of a wooden screen with gaping missing poles. If we wanted hot water, we would have to light a fire under a donkey \"large metal drum\" with the fear of setting the environment on fire. Brave the shower with a freezing wind blowing through the gaps, just to find a treacle of water from the shower head. \nThe kitchen was filthy (photograph attached) with minimum utencils. So much dust under the beds, we could have planted maize. The one good thing is that the beds were comfortable with clean bedding. \nThe staff offered us the dormitories where at least we could have hot showers, but needless to say, we had to pack up and move again! \nThe game viewing was extraordinary! We drove ourselves and saw all but the Black Rhino's. \nWe had booked and paid for a guided game drive, but with this unpleasant vibe, we wanted to cancel. This we were not allowed to do for a refund. We went, saw less animals but Duncan, the guide was informative and friendly. All in all, the Rhinos made the day.\nBottomline....... Not worth it! \nWe could have camped in more comfort and still see all the animals! \nTotally overpriced at R5000 for two nights.",

  "text": "This was part of my intrepid tour, having been on safari in Tanzania and only seen rhinos at a distance this was potentially the most exciting part of my itinerary. I can’t really judge the experience based on seeing the rhinos as in the couple of hours we had we only had two brief sightings. The vegetation is extremely thick meaning you rely on the rhinos being in visible areas at the right time! Would fully recommend doing a couple of drives here if you do really want to increase your chance of encounters! The purpose of the sanctuary is amazing though and the work they do there is fantastic.",

You will see different kinds of animals and also learn which ones are rare to see like the leopard..it is really a nice place where you can go as partners, family or for business excursion.

  "text": "We decided to stay over for a few days, normally people would use Khama as a stopover. It was well worth is, we saw many animals, the roads between water holes are quite sandy, but as you would probably be there in a 4X4 it should not be a issue. The restaurant, although limited in offerings in off peak times, makes good pizza, and there is free wifi. Its a good idea to buy enough wood while at Khama, the quality is very high...slightly expensive at 25p per bag, but quality makes up for it!",

  "text": "This was our only opportunity to see Rhinos in Botswana. We did, but that only tells part of the story. Spending a bit of time watching family groups is a real reward. The highlight however wasn't the Rhinos but a family of giraffes. Two young ones sat in the road being watched by their mother who was fending off the advance of her very handsome partner. Getting to witness all the interactions was a real treat.\nWe booked an evening game drive (£50 for 2) , although we could have driven ourselves and probably would have if it was a little later in the holiday and we'd had more experience driving on sand tracks.\nThe accommodation is fairly basic but clean. The mosquito net didn't fit which meant we got a couple of bites - but hey ho. The food was good and very affordable.",

There are also a few black rhinos but they are more shy and not that easy to spot. Since the place is well guarded and protected against poachers, the rhinos are also used to people and one can get quite close to them (in the vehicle).\nThe chalets are very basic, with mosquito nets that do not fit the beds and have holes in them. This made the sleeping experience rather challenging, taking into consideration that there are MANY crawling and flying insects around when the evening falls...",

The internal roads are well sign-posted and its easy to spend up to 5 hours cruising around appreciating the animals and the environment. \n\nIf you're on your way to the Okavango Delta, stay overnight at Serowe Hotel, only 30kms drive from the sanctuary. Enjoy either a morning or evening game drive at the sanctuary, you can use your own vehicle, or book a game drive at the sanctuary reception. \n\nIf you live in the area, this is something you should be doing every weekend!",

After we were all set up we were picked up by a few game drive vehicles and set off to spot some Rhinos. We saw many animals along the way and after seeing a few lots of rhinos from the distance we stumbled upon a group of rhinos, with a baby!!! It was so cute and came up really close to the vehicle.

Also it was not open which made it impossible for communication between the driver and participants and vice versa.\n\nThere is a nice little souvenir shop at the entrance.  The Sanctuary is definitely worth a visit to support the efforts to conserve this endangered species.",

  "text": "This is quite a small place to do a Safari which is good because there are 50+ rhinos here so you're more likely to stumble along one. We were there for 10 mins and bumped into about 15 at the first watering hole!\n\nWe also ran into a few giraffe and zebra. All that we've seen before at the big parka but never this close. \n\nIt doesn't have any of the other 'big five' but that's not what you come here for. It cost 900p to do an afternoon game drive (including entry for two).\n\nThe staff are all very nice, and it's great that all the profits go to community projects and the sanctuary but it would be great if they had an information centre to learn about all of the great work they do and stuff about the rhinos. Especially for those who choose to do a self drive safari.\n\n",

  "text": "We spent four great days in Chalets C and D here - in the depths of the game reserve! You can camp - but we prefer the chalets. We cooked on the braai every day - self-catering and we did not leave the sanctuary until our stay was over. It was brilliant! \nThe accommodation is adequate - this is not meant to be a hotel! You are in the middle of the bush. You open your door in the morning and you never know what you will see! One day, a large antelope was staring back at me - then it just moved slightly and it disappeared - camouflaged behind the trees!\n\nYou need a 4WD - and the rule is that you stay in it, come what may. The animals then know that, when they see a car with people, they are safe, so you can get quite close to them - or rather, they can get very close to you!\n\nThe rhino are justly famous - but we saw zebra, warthog, giraffe, kudu, impala, oryx, steenbok, waterbuck, wildebeest, ostrich, hartebeest, eland, springbok, black-back jackal, mongoose, kori bustard, francolin, guinea fowl, grey lourie, emerald spotted dove and loads of other birds, including vultures and storks. We went in winter (end of August) and the bush was quite devoid of leaves so visibility was very good.\n\nThe Khama Rhino Sanctuary (KRS) is a community based wildlife project and it deserves to succeed! \n\nWe took nothing but photos and left nothing but footprints! Fantastic!",

  "text": "The 9-day 8-night Okavango Expeditions camping Safari, Kasane to Maun, with 2 nights in 4 different  campsites, starting in Chobe, was a marvellous experience.  Tour guides/drivers Paul & Ossi had superb fauna/flora, knowledge, binocular-grade eyesight &, seemingly a 6th sense on where to find elusive animals.  The food was amazing, especially considering the prep. conditions and the team setting up and taking down the en-suite (bush style!)  tents, with beds, were streamlined and speedy - an all-round excellent experience.  Sitting under the star-studded sky, with lions grunting not far off, plus other animal communications during the night, just added to the experience.",

  "text": "We explored the Okavango delta with Sanctuary Stanley's camp during the dry season (late May) and I have to say that the Okavango delta is one of the most beautiful areas I've ever seen in Africa.  The amount of animals and the variety of animals that we saw...well, we've never seen that many before.  And when the rains come and the entire area floods, the same animals are still there, but their habits/behaviors change accordingly.  So we're longing to go back during the rainy season to see the entire area again...but completely new to us again.  Definitely go here!!",

Once there the campsite was set up for us.\nWe done bush walking where we were taught about the local wildlife. Right outside the camp site we had elephants and hippos. On the first night I was awoken by elephants passing through the camp!\nWe bathed in a natural pool right by our camp.\nThis was definitely the highlight of my 2-week trip.",

  "text": "We spend a good week on a safari starting from Maun, ending in Kasane / Victoria Falls and loved the Xakanax area in Okavango Delta most. We opted for a tailor-made tented safari through a company called \"Sekanka Safari\", which we can recommend to anybody looking for a small safari company to take their family on the safari of a life time. When looking at safaris we wanted to do it all: Okavango Delta, Chobe, Moreni, Savuti, Victoria Falls, under the assumption that the areas would be very different from each other. In reality they are not that different allthough we found the Xakanaxa area to be the most stunning of all. We were very lucky with the game sights we had there and perhaps that helps with our preference for that area. After those, the game ride in Chobe felt very average. I know that sounds very snobbish but after such an amazing start of our safari tour I guess we were spoiled ;-).",

  "text": "The Delta has been on my wife’s bucket list for many years, so it was great that we finally managed to visit and, due to covid, with relatively few tourists. Apart from our game drives, we decided to take a scenic flight (with Major Blue Air out of Maun) which is great if you don’t mind a small plane and a few bumps here and there. \n\nWe saw all of wildlife we’d hoped for as well as getting a much better appreciation of the delta.",

  "text": "It was amazing to be in such a special place that changes so much based on the annual rainfall and water seasons. Quiet, peaceful, solitary. The stars were amazing!!! It was so fun to camp out in the bush, listening to our neighboring hippos! The makoro rides are fun and the walking safaris were humbling and insightful, though the animals kept their distance. We barely entered the edge of the Delta and would love to go deeper into the Delta next time. Our experience was heightened by the possibility that the Okavango might not get water forever because of increased water consumption in Angola. This amazing place will be greatly changed, so go there now before its gone. Botswana is an amazing country with friendly and welcoming people!",

  "text": "We had an absolutely amazing six-night journey from beginning to end. Mmegi met us at the airport and took us to our pre-Safari destination, then collected us again and made sure we were airport ready… we arrived in Moremi for a 3-night stay, and was met by our guide Lucas, it was nonstop excitement from the word go, we saw a small pride of male lions before we even arrived at camp. and then drove to Khwai for 3 nights. Each location had a different feel and experience. Our Guide, Lucas was extremely knowledgeable and did not pass an opportunity to turn every occasion into an adventure, from spotting and chasing a leopard, not just once but twice! To leading us to a herd of 500+ strong buffalo, not once but twice, different locations. We saw elephants, lions, loads of hippos, giraffes, zebra, warthogs, wildebeest, African wild cat, wild dogs, Lechwe and a rare buck called the Roan antelope. Not to mention all the birds, flora and crocodiles. The best part was 2 mating African rock pythons. The river Mokoro excursion in Khwai was just awesome. I also enjoyed the walking safari.\n\nThe camping facilities are fantastic, way more than I expected. Elliot delivered a warm shower to our en suite every afternoon and warm water to wash with every morning. Elliot and KT had our tents and camp cleaned and we had a surprise towel origami on our beds every day. This all in the African mobile bush safari!\n\nNow the best part !!!! the food - was astounding what they created on a camp fire. KK cooked up three course dinners every night plus lunches and warm breakfasts. A freshly baked cake every day, felt like I was in a 5-star hotel! Lucas had wonderful stories to share at dinner time, and around the campfire.\n\nComing back from a drive, we would be welcomed with a welcome song, smiles, a cold drink and warm washcloths for our faces and hands. And a blazing campfire.\n\nMmegi made sure we were covid tested before we said our goodbyes…\n\nThank you Letaka Safaris and team for sharing your playground with us for a short while…",

  "text": "We had a 3 days/2 nights camping in Okavango Delta. The area itself is just breath-taking. Beautiful landscapes, many birds and animals, I couldn’t put my camera down. We didn’t see any cats close, but we could hear them. That is probably a case when we were glad not to meet them, because we were walking and not driving! We also had to keep a good distance from hippos and buffalos. It’s a place that makes you feel that you are so little without machines and equipment. And there were no mosquitos at all!\n\nIt was our first camping experience, so many things were very new for us. However, with the help of our local guide Philip we quickly adapted to the conditions. Philip was fantastic, he was explaining us everything, making the biggest accent on our safety, but also doing everything possible for our comfort and entertainment. His knowledge about local wild life is phenomenal. We have learnt the official and local names of different species, many interesting facts about their lives and habits. Philip was shaping our walks and boat trips according to our wishes and interests and nothing was too much trouble for him.  \n\nUnfortunately, our guide and tour organiser Pastor Maswanganyi from Swangs safaris, who was providing the 10 day tour from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls, was totally different. Before the trip he was telling us how well he knows the area, but in the Delta we weren’t provided with any information from him at all. Quite the opposite, he treated the trip like a personal holiday and was communicating only with local guides in the local language, spending time with a female guide, disappearing with her for a long time.    That was the only beginning of our sad experience with Pastor Maswanganyi, later he has just escaped with our money, but that is a different story in a different review… \n\nNow we understand how lucky we were with Philip! If not for him, we would feel totally abandoned and helpless, and wouldn’t be able to enjoy the Okavango Delta. So we have learnt a lesson – check the guide you are going to trust your money and life, and, when you think you have checked, do it again!",

  "text": "We have visited many reserves and national parks in Southern Africa and the Okavango Delta is still the top destination for us. \nThere are no telephone and electricity poles, there are no tarred roads, no fences in sight and no need to do anything else but take in the magnificent scenery. \nThe Delta caters to all pockets, from incredible luxury to self drive campers. \nThere is no 'best time' to visit, however every season offers something different yet worthwhile experiencing. If you have never been before, then the winter months from May to July is where you should start as the 'flood waters' are in and the Delta becomes this amazing water wonderland. A flight over the Delta is worth every cent if you are not flying into a lodge. \nWhen planning a trip make sure you use an agent who has been there themselves so that they know what will suit you and your pocket best as there are hundreds of options to choose from. Lodges, overland safaris, and self drive each offer many levels of luxury and experiences, so choose an agent who knows the Delta.\nThe birdlife is exquisite and we usually find ourselves concentrating on the birds and the animal sightings end up finding us while we are birding. Your guide will quickly find out what is on your 'must see' wishlist and will endeavour to make it a reality. There are no guarantees though, as the Delta is not a zoo or animal park. Try not to be too rigid with your list or you can end up stressed and miss out on many other things. We always find that just watching the sun rise and set is enough. \n",

The Botswana govt has done a good job of limiting access so that it does not seem overcrowded. I know several people who have visited there after going to Kenya and told me they wished they would have gone to the Okavango first and never have gone to Kenya. Kenya was too much like Hollywood!!",

Balancing friendly interactions and steering a safe journey through hippos and crocodiles and later in the evening, the pleasure of listening to them sing and dance around the campfire 👌🏼 Superb!",

  "text": "There are quite a lot of private lodges in the Okavango Delta.  It was not a cheap holiday but we certainly have fantastic memories that we will treasure for many years to come.  The game viewing is just fantastic.  For most of the private lodges you can fly in on a small chartered plane to the nearest air strip and you can expect fully inclusive service with fantastic hospitality and game viewing.  We stayed in Mma Dinare and Splash camps.  I recommend staying at more than one lodge in different parts of the delta as they had very different vegetation and game viewing experiences.  Mma Dinare and Splash are both excellent.",

  "text": "We went to The Okavango nine years ago and swore to go back. This year we made it and it is still a superb place to go for wildlife, but changing and not for the better.\n\nIt is dry, arid, scorched. Many of the animals (the herbivores especially) are very thin because of the poor grazing. Also, the elephant damage is tremendous. On our last visit we remember dense bush, now there are many areas which are wide open and with smashed down trees.\n\nAlso, the number of vehicles has increased dramatically with many days trips from Maun. Often these seem to be old and poorly maintained vehicles. Frankly, limits need to be placed on access sooner rather than later.\n\nWe had amazing sightings in The Okavango, but worry that the damage caused by mankind is becoming overwhelming. ",

  "text": "I recently spent 4 days in Nxai Pan with African Bush Camps, and didn’t want to leave. The camps are mobile: they change every week or so, and the pan, (my first salt pan experience!) was lovely. Lots of open views, prides of lions, springbok, raptors, bee eaters, bat-eared foxes and jackals. Very few other people.  ABC took great care of me: You gotta love the combination of canvas walls and compost toilets with a wine steward and remarkably tasty meals. \nMy guide, Ken, was expert at spotting all manner of wildlife, wonderful company, and intuitively knew how best to position the vehicle for optimal photo opps.  I am very grateful for his good work!  I was a little early for the zebra migration:  they were arriving just as I had to move on, but this is a special place, well worth revisiting.",

  "text": "Baines Baobab is an extraordinary place with large Baobab trees sitting on the edge of an extensive salt pan. Camp sites are situated around the pan but are miles apart. Each site is clean, and has a long drop toilet and bucket shower, but take your own water. \n\nWe camped here for one night after staying on Ntwetwe pan and it was a great experience. We were only slightly phased by finding lion spore on the ground in front of the truck after we had set up camp. We expected to have a disturbed night but actually had a good night’s sleep in perfect peace. \n\nThe drive into Baines is currently (September 2019) rather challenging, the long road in has deep sand and once heading towards the pan we had an extended wait while some trucks ahead of us helped release another which was axle deep. It was necessary to drive for extended periods in low ratio so go with a full tank.\n\nWe had wanted to go to the waterhole to the north of the park, and in fact drove part of the way there. However we had to turn back as the sand was far too deep and soft to venture any further. We were in serious danger of being bogged down. As we were a lone vehicle, with little other traffic, we decided that the risk of an extended stop in 38 degrees was too much.\n\nThe camp area was great, remote from other sites, well swept and with a long drop toilet and shower. Of course, there is no water, but we carried our own.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay at Baines, would we go back. Indeed yes, but probably at a different time of year.",

It is absolutely silent on the pan at night and the stars at night, the dawns and the sunsets are beautiful. It takes a while to get to the Baines Baobabs on the very sandy road from the gate so recommend a two night stay to really soak up the atmosphere. Our teens thought this was one of the top highlights of our trip through Botswana.",

  "text": "Kwando Camp drove me here – we started late morning and got here mid-day. The road was sandy but you don’t get dusty because there is very little traffic. Carry a jacket and cap if you do the trip in July. I didn’t see any animals on the drive to or from the trees but saw a lot of  birds – Kori Bustard, Red Crested Korhaan, Northern Black Korhaan, Double Banded Courser, Bateleur, etc. Got there mid-day which was not the best time for photographs. I was anyway overwhelmed by the trees and could not find creative angles. If you are a shutter-bug, I suggest looking at some photographs beforehand so that you can capture the magical nature of the landscape like a pro. Look into the distance across the salt pan to see a mirage of water. Across this grove on the other side on the pan is a picnic spot under a solitary Baobab and rest rooms are available. \n",

  "text": "The 136km road between Maun and Nxai Pan has sections which are badly potholed so the drive took 1.5 hours. It was a 1 hour drive to Baine's Campsites once inside the park on a very sandy road. There are only 3 Baine's campsites and they are not right by the iconic Baobabs. Campsite 1 is on the island opposite the Baobabs, camp 2 further down that island and camp 3 further still, each with their own Baobab and quite a distance from each other. Long drop toilet and a bucket shower system but no water. There is a braai although ours had not been cleaned. The campsite and isolation is stunning with memorable sunsets over the pans. \nThe game is more North towards Nxai Pan (South Camp) because of the permanent water source.",

  "text": "The cluster of enormous baobabs are reached by a long, sandy, 4WD road (about 45 minutes from the park entrance). The rangers will advise you which roads to use, depending on the conditions. The trees stand in stark relief to the flat white pans around them and are a welcome oasis for body and soul.\nWe camped overnight in campsite number 2 (a couple of kilometres from the trees) in a pretty spot with its own baobab trees, a bbq area, shower and pit toilet. Note there is no water at the campsite - you must be self-sufficient and bring everything in.\nIf you want to listen to silence, see the sky blanketed in stars, and feel disconnected from the hustle and bustle for a day or two then this is the place to visit.

  "text": "Well, you don't really camp \"under\" the trees, but the baobabs are so massive that you'll definitely be sleeping under their leaves. \n\nI highly recommend driving to Baines even if you're not camping--and even though it's a good distance from the main track in Nxai Pan NP--because the environment out there is so interesting and unique. Also, you have a better chance to see gemsbok (oryx), as they live in those desert-y kind of climates like the pans. (We saw one in the evening and then the next morning loping across the pans, which was really cool, and then we saw a small herd of them on the drive back towards the main dirt track). \n\nIf you can, I recommend camping out there as well. It's a beautiful, weird, interesting place, and you'll be well alone if you camp at Site 3, as the other sites are clear across the pans (or, rather, you have to drive across the pan to get to Site 3). We camped in the middle of a raging electrical storm, and though I didn't get much sleep, I'm still happy to have stayed a night out there. \n\nThere's a fire pit but that's it for facilities--which is no problem at all. The more natural the environment, the better! \n\nYou need to book through Xomae Group, which I recommend doing online ahead of time, but we did luck out and switch to a night earlier while we were at the office inside the park.",

The area is famous for the big elephant males who enjoy this mostly dry area.\nThe only carnivores we saw were jackals but we heard lions and saw some tracks.",

The pitch we had was large and totally removed from any other so we had complete privacy. Being in the pan itself, we felt safe from wildlife. This is not a place to go to for several days but it's well worth a stop in. If you have the perseverance to deal with dire booking processes that seem to be the norm across Botswana.\n\nThe Nxai pan didn't give us much in the way of animals but passing conversations with another visitor suggested the day before had been much better. So we were unlucky.  That said, we had our most rewarding lion spot of the whole trip so we can't complain!",

  "text": "Very peaceful, away from it all place.  We had a puncture on our way so arrrived in the dark, but managed to find the campsite.  Incredible waking up to the pan and baobabs the next morning.  The only other people we saw were a few day trippers visiting.  We were pleased to see there is a toilet long drop properly set up and a bucket shower, both on concret bases.  \nAmazing stars!",

  "text": "After a rough 4x4 drive over the savannah you'll get to the first set of baobabs from where you can drive over to one of the three private camp sites (a few KMs apart). You'll be driving over the crusty salt pan where erosion of various sorts has created flakes and bits of various shapes and shades of green-gray colors. Unique.\nWe drove over and around the pan (on the tracks, of course!) at sunset and the pictures turned out beautiful.\n \nThe campsites underneath the baobabs are very spacious and has a very basic private ablution block. In our case, there was no tap or otherwise running water and as we had only had a few bottles of drinking water with us, no refreshing bucket shower for us..\n\nAs it is quite a hostile, dry, and remote place to camp, you have to make sure you are mentally prepared and have the necessary supplies with you, and then you may very well likely end up loving the unique charm of the pans and its baobabs.",

The road to get to Baines Baobabs was quite corrugated and has thick sand in a few places but generally not too difficult, the pans around Baines Baobabs cannot be driven after lots of rain so make sure before you go. The Baobabs themselves are spectacular and can be visited in a few hours or you can camp close by. we loved camping there as it is isolated with almost no people nearby, great for photography and star trails, In July it gets quite cold at Night so be prepared, I will definitely return one day.",

  "text": "Camp site Nr 2 at Baines baobabs, 2 nights. \nSecond visit. This place is not an easy drive, quite thick sand, need a good 4x4. We towed a trailer and got stuck, but the detour much easier than the old track. \n\n3 campsites, about a km apart each. Nr 1 best view on boababs with spectacular sunsets. A primitive bucket shower and toilet is provided, but no water or electricity. You need to be fully self sufficient. \nBut the reward is absolute solitude, sunsets and stars to die for. \n\nWill I be back, I want to keep this for myself and come back every year!",

(There are a few more campsites, all far away and apart from each other). If you are looking for a magic place to stay for a night in the absolute wilderness and with no human presence, this is the one! Private, remote, peaceful. Magnificent sunset. Owls and jackals howling around us. This was our favourite campsite in Botswana! \n\nThis is a campsite that you need to have water, food, fire wood etc with you. There is only a long drop and a bucket shower. You need to book well ahead in advance, as there are very few places (we booked 12 months in advance and got the no1!)\nA truly magnificent experience.",

These baobabs are really worth the visit as is the Nxai national park.  Having visited many national parks in Southern Africa, and reading the books on this, I was surprised to see so much game, plenty of antilope, giraffe and zebra, and even lions.  Really worth the visit. And for an affordable price if you stay in Maun.",

  "text": "The initial idea of spending a day to travel out to view a set of trees was not at all inspiring, however I soon realised it was not just about a tree or two.  Firstly, they are a group of 7 baobab trees which is unusual in itself. The trees are very old and are more recently (1860's) associated with European travel within seriously remote Botswana. Secondly, the salt pans are a typical example of where much of the water travelling into Botswana ends up. Worth a visit if you are there during the drier months. Thirdly, we saw lots of animals (especially giraffes) along the way as it was April and there was still plenty of vegetation around.\n\nWe were the only visitors during the morning, which was convenient as there are no amenities, only 7 trees and a lot of salt pan!  We arrived, took photos of baobabs, baobab fruit with insects, us with baobabs, ate lunch prepared by our guides and departed.  An interesting place, however it is a long trip from anywhere.  Make sure that whole journey and not just the destination is worth the travel.",

  "text": "I'm just absolutely gobsmacked that this place has such high reviews. People go to Botswana  to see wildlife and they usually have to drive pretty far to the campsites, This  drive took it to all new levels unforeseen for the whole world. Not only getting there really sucked, the signs   lie about how many kilometers it takes to get there (72 km sign says actually 100 km!)  and on the tire got awful drive  there was no wildlife , but just cattle and lots of it!.  I should have read the description before you attempted to get there. Seriously whose world travelers itinerary is to see a bunch of rocks and fossilized bird poop?!  No thanks so I turned around and went to another campsite more to my taste. On top of that, a friend of ours went there  and said there's no ablutions and the wind was so bad that they had to  physically hold the tent all night long  so it wouldn't blow away and there were  two strangers that drove around the camp at 2:00 a.m. in a pickup truck. This is the worst campsite of all of Botswana.  I don't get these people thinking it's good. It is God awful. If you want to see a bunch of cattle and drive to eternity for something that serves absolutely no point other than a lot of wind no water, ablutions ( not even those buckets you fill) and no toilet then to each his own ",

  "text": "We visited 25 years ago and were amazed again about the beauty of this utterly remote place. It is surely worth a visit once in a lifetime. Very sad that elephants have damaged some of the ancient Baobab trees. The reception area was deserted, but staff came to collect our camping fee, as we had not booked. The pit toilets were amazingly clean and water in big containers are provided for flushing. There is no water or electricity available, so you have to be totally selfsufficient. Your vehicle is your lifeline here and should be in a good condition as a breakdown may result in waiting days for other vehicles to pass. Roads are only tracks but in reasonable condition this time of the year, as many vehicles have compacted the tracks. Do NOT attemt to visit in the rainy season or shortly after when pans are tsill wet, you WILL certainly get stuck !!",

Serene and peaceful and a great escape from the real world. \n\nIt is hard to explain how a group of rocks and Baobabs surrounded by nothing can be so magical, but it is. \n\nThe excellent community project based at Mmatshumo will get you there if you lack a 4x4 at very reasonable rates. The facilities are basic but match the place itself. Just be aware that you need to be self-sustaining in terms of food and water, although firewood is available.",

  "text": "Kubu Island is absolutely worth a stop if you're at all interested in nature (particularly weird rocky outcrops with huge baobabs, there's even an archaeological site tucked away here). We planned out roadtrip around Botswana to incorporate a stop at Kubu Island and it did not disappoint. Travelling through the pans can be challenging at times but after the hours of yellow grass on the salt pans Kubu Island definitely stands out (although getting their is a bit of a challenge since it is poorly signed). Very glad that we opted to stay at the Gaing O Community campsite because it meant that we ended up having the island almost entire to ourselves and we could watch the sunrise in the morning. ",

  "text": "Situated miles from anywhere this is a place to experience Botswana open spaces. Take your own water, remove your own waste, and no power or WiFi means you experience the expanse and desolation  of the salt pans. We played cricket on the edge of the pan, the kids found clay in the pan and spent hours making clay animals which we fired in the camp fire.  The sunrise and sunsets were amazing. We were there at full moon so didn’t really experience the stars. We entered from the south and exited on the road between Nata and Gweta. The sand track from Kubu to the main road is sandy and bouncy and great fun. A 4x4 is recommended but my non 4x4 Fortuner and non 4x4 trailer did just fine. ",

  "text": "We stayed at Planet Baobab the night before heading to Kubu Island. Great lodge with good bar/restaurant and giant baobabs all around and lit up at night. 3 different people said That there is no road, only tracks that often lead in different directions with no signs from Greta to Kubu Island and they strongly encouraged us not to go for fear of getting lost. Our GPS died earlier that day so we ended up getting a guy to escort us there. Well after 3 1/2 hours of driving on crazy tracks through sand, dirt, with big shrubs scratching the camper, going over the salt pans we made it. There is no way we would have found it on our own. The guide said goodbye and we got a great site overlooking the pan. It was magical and we got great night sky shots and pics of the baobabs. We stayed there 2 nights and found a couple that had come in from the south which had an actual road which was so easy to follow(saw meerkats Along the way). Had a long trip back to Gweta but nice tar road and saw a lot of animals. So glad we went!",

We stayed in GPS 3. Long drop toilet. No power. No water. Fire pit. \nWe had difficulty finding the camp coming from the North. Do NOT FOLLOW ORANGE BLOCKS - they lead you East across the pan to the soda ash factory if you can get that far without getting stuck. We drove South along the pan which was nice until we hit a fence line and had to drive West along it getting the car very scratched as many overgrown acacias.",

  "text": "Lekhubu Island, also known as Kubu Island, is a must see historical site in the Makgadikgadi Pans, administered by the Botswana National Museum. The 65km route from Letlakane needs a 4x4 and takes more than two hours through the Makgadikgadi Pans.  We lost the route a few times, even back-tracked twice, because of a lack of indicators and a myriad of re-routes where people had been stuck in the mud before. We visited in August when the Pans were dry.  It will possibly be quite a treacherous drive during the rainy season. Kubu is an unexpected spectacle of rocks and baobab trees surrounded by kilometers of flat salt pans that blend with the horizon in all directions. One can see how it will literally be an island during the wet season. We saw many different bird species and signs of animal life - fresh antelope tracks and old elephant dung. This place deserves all the stars that covers it like a dome at night - for its setting and for its uniqueness! But sadly, for the price one pays compared to other camping sites, it lacks the very basics. There's no facilities, no water, only a few long drop toilets and a dilapidated house where people check on your booking and sell wood. And none of this information was supplied when we made the booking through the Gaing-O-Community Trust.  kubu.island@btcmail.co.bw",

You cannot describe the beauty of a sunset on Kubu and the contrast and vastness of the salt pans! You must however be prepared to endure to see the beauty. The drive is long and slow and you need to bring everything yourself, including water. The camps have a chemical toilet now, which was very clean for the circumstances, but you need to be used to that sort of thing. ",

  "text": "We stayed at Kubu Island for 1 evening toward the end of our time in Botswana. The trip there is not far on a GPS or a map but it takes VERY long to get there so best to plan for an early start too your day. We arrived a bit late but the camp site was lovely. There is nothing... at all... just you, your gear and nature. There are a lot of foxes and we saw some antelope but no sign of larger animals. The baobab trees are amazing and the sunset and sunrise... breath-taking. The stars in the evening were beautiful. We put out the fire and all light and sat in the middle of nowhere looking at the stars. Incredible. It is quite expensive for a place that literally offers you a piece of land, but I would say it is worth it.",

  "text": "Awesome drive to get there.  Get to drive over an ancient water pan.  Camping spaces are all good, there is no way one is a bad spot.  Spent the whole afternoon hiking and walking.  There is a stone wall at the top that dates back to the 1200s, Also has fossilized bird guana.  That night was crazy as we had 50-60 mph winds, but our tent and 4x4 made it through.  A must to bring water, as there is none around there.  There are built in toilet holes that were surprisingly clean, be sure to have your own toilet paper.\n\nJust a note, when you go thhhhrough Mmsathumo and come to a gravel toad, look a little to the right and you will see a small sign for Lekkuba.  It is CORRECT.  You really can't get lost, but it is sand and gravel for 17km.  WHen you get to the vet gate, if no one os there, open it and be sure to close it as well.Driving the rest of the way is so cool.",

  "text": "Kubu island is perfect as a stopover as part of a 4x4 trip. There are a number of camping sites to choose from, each with its own long-drop toilet. Don't expect any luxuries here though. You will need to take everything you need along with you. The staff provided us with fire wood, but it is best to check with them before hand in case they don't have any. We went for a guided tour of the island, which was quite informative. \n\nIf you plan to drive anywhere from the island across the pan I would advise you to talk to the staff first. Often the pan is wetter than it looks and you WILL get stuck, even in the best 4x4 (Toyota, obviously). We helped a bunch of people out of the mud on our short 2 day stay there. It is a nightmare to get a vehicle out of the pan once it is stuck. I would not suggest crossing the pan in a single vehicle ever. Always remember, even if the pan looks dry, it may be wet just below the surface. If you are foolish enough to drive over the pan, take a known route, don't try and make a new road. Take all the equipment you need to get unstuck, you will find nothing to aid in the pan, not even rocks.\n\nNote that this is  a popular stop, and there may be quite a few people when you get there. Book in advance.\n\nEnjoy!",

  "text": "We missioned there in 4x4 trucks (only recommended) and came from the North (Nata). It's a good track (when dry) but pay attention to where you driving because it's easy to veer off onto other tracks and get seriously lost. \n\nEntering the salt pans is awesome. Stay on the track as it's muddy every where else. \n\nCheck in with the house on where to camp. Now BEWARE the \"park ranger\" there, Moola, tried to charge us double what is stated in the parks paper work. We new the price wasn't right and told him no ways. We paid and asked for a receipt. He laughed and put the cash in his pocket. \n\nHe came around to check on us, in what seemed a sincere way, but for sure was trying to pull a long one on us.\n\nAnyway, we camped for two nights. There are ZERO facilities beyond a couple random outhouses. \n\nThe photography is awesome as the scenery is just unreal. \n",

  "text": "Natural Beauty at its best. If your are passing through Botswana traveling from North to South or South to North, you must make time for at least a sunset and sunrise at Kubu Island. \n\nThe campsites are Beautiful, hugging the west side of the Hill on Kubu island. The whole place is something else though. There is no water and the toilets....well, lets just say that the shovel and hike experience might be more enjoyable than using the pit loo's here.\n\nWe drove in from the South in October 2016. The rd was very dry and we had no problem. Driving out we took the North East route North to meet the A3 Between Zoroga and Nata. This was a beautiful very sandy drive. I would not recommend this route to anyone who is in a hurry or who does not have a vehicle with high clearance. ",

  "text": "I camped for one night at Kubu Island, the road in and out was mostly good with a few tough sections with deep ruts, we chose to go in the dry season so that we would not battle with getting stuck, I think if you go to Kubu Island in the rainy season you should be prepared for tough road conditions and possibly drive with other vehicles to assist if you get stuck.The facilities at Kubu are basic and no water was available and there is no shop to buy anything, you need to be self sustainable.The Island is beautiful and has amazing Baobab trees and huge big Granite boulders, it was nice and peaceful and great for Landscape photography and star photography, watching the sunrise was spectacular, I think a great stop for one night in a magical place.",

  "text": "Kubu Island is an impessing spot in botswana. First the way to get to the island through the pans, which can be a challenge, if there is a little humidity. If the rainy season has started, it's probably impossible to go there. If you are in the dry season, there are more rumours than actual difficulties. But it's still a trip. You have to stick to your gps, because there are several tracks which you better do not follow. You never know, where they bring you to. \nAt kubu island you will find total stillness, beside some birds which nest in the baobabs. The evenly landscape gives so much peace to the eyes in the daytime and at night there stary sky is unbelivable. If you have moon, you will be surprised how bright everything is. You don't need a torch or anything to go for a little walk on the rocks. \nThe camp site is very basic. So bring everything you need.\nWe stayed there two nights to really enjoy the stillness, peace and remoteness of the place. I would do it like this again.",

There is nothing but the 'long drop' loos spaced between clearings in which you can camp. The Zimbabwe ruins are worth a walk as is climbing up to the highest point on the 1km long  Island, and going to the edge of the pan is like standing on the edge of the works with nothing in front of you.

  "text": "So, when there are not clean toilets, what do people do?  They use the bush.  As a result this place is littered with soiled toilet paper, and unfortunately, if you have to go you have to go.  What a pity that such nice place does not understand the concept of hygiene.  The road from Maun is one of the worst sandy roads you can imagine---apparently because they have a huge \"RUNNING FOR RHINOS\" event once a year where people fly small aeroplanes on the pans etc. etc.  What a pity that because of the price of money these people will allow this place to be destroyed.  They dont hesitate to take large groups of bikers who go wild on the pans, as all of this is money.  Surely we would have thought that the Botswana Government, when giving out such Community Projects will educate the people who run the place about hygiene and saving our lovely planet.    If you are looking for the toilet, just walk around, and you will smell it from about 5 metres way...dont even dare to open the door!  Why could the people in charge not just build new toilets when they see the toilets are full...maybe they dont want to face it either!  And in September/October, dont expect a single leaf...so make sure you take your own shade.  Sunset and the night sky is lovely.",

  "text": "We drove in from Nata but it took us five hours each way on a deep sand road - not for 4x2 vehicles...you will get stuck.   The site was larger than I expected and we would have benefited from a better guide to learn more of the history and mystique of this magical place.  There are a number of sandy campsites - not on the salt pan -  but no provisions, water or other supplies; you must take everything in with you. The 'long drops' were disgusting and the evidence of toilet paper in the surrounding shrub led to its own conclusions.   We were disappointed in the sunrise, it was partly obscured with dust or smoke during our visit but the extent of the salt pan was remarkable.",

The dust is everywhere. When you arrived at the Island immediately the beauty replace the bad road. The lady at reception is friendly and very positive about her work for the last 6 years. The campsite is big and can accommodate at least 3 groups of 4x4 trailers. You must bring everything with. There is wood along the road for sale, buy enough. There is only a long drop (very suspect). If you go to Kubu the main activity is photography. Make sure you scout the area well before sunset. This was one of the most   beautiful places I have ever visited.",

  "text": "There are more baobabs than I was expecting, and if you spend enough time walking around the rocky outcrop you may be lucky enough to spot a bonsai baobab that managed to pop up among the rocks - I'd love to know how old this little miniature version is?!\nThe sun set and full moon rising was spectacular, and the silence is incredible.\nI'd love to return with a new moon to be able to experience the stars better - light of the full moon does dampen the stars a little.\nThere are many camp sites, and although one is able to pitch camp relatively far apart, it can become disturbing when others are active or social at night - perhaps do enquiries to try and avoid groups (we spent most of the early hours of the morning listening to a large group pitch camp... noise travels very far here, especially when others are oblivious to the disturbance they are creating).\nBe warned, the pit toilets are horrid, especially in the heat of the day.... so watch your step as many obviously choose to make a litter box out of the surrounding veld or sandy patches...\nTake everything you may need (water, sleeping and cooking equipment, etc.) as there is absolutely nothing there, and take everything back with you! I hope that those whose visit will help preserve this magnificent escape from reality.\nWe will definitely spend 2 nights next time so as to explore the rocky outcrop more!\nThe staff that tended to us were very friendly.",

  "text": "Ever since my first visit to Kubu Island, I wanted to return to this magical place.  We were on our way from Maun to Nata when we decided to take a detour to the Makgadigadi pans.  We phoned and got a campsite.  \n\nThe road to Kubu is challenging in the dry season and I would not venture there in the rainy season.  This is part of the mistery of the place.  In the middle of the pan you find this granite island filled with age old baobab trees.  This is a dry camp so you need to bring your own water.  The long drop toilets are not the best and we used the nearest tree with a shovel.  Wood is for sale, but we were ripped off.  For Pula 18 we got 5 pieces of wood where two years ago we got a wheelbarrow full.  I think were also overcharged as SADC citizens, but as we arrived late, could not do much about it.\n\nApart from logistics, this remains a magical mystical place like nothing else on earth.  The stars are so bright and everything is so quite.  The sunset and sunrise with the hundreds of baobabs is something to behold.  This is a magic place and something to put  your Bucket list.",

  "text": "Once you get to the island you are hit by the mystical feeling that surrounds you - this dried up lake that has spurned the so called island is a place to come and feel at 'one' with nature and the universe. We arrived at sunset, just an hour to go before we saw the sun sink and the moon rise. There is no wood to be salvaged on the island, so make sure that you take your won or buy from the gate when you book to come. \n\nIt was still warm as we pitched our tents for the night - this did not stop us lighting a small camp fire, getting the chairs out and just sitting and watching the night sky appear and the milky way unfold before our very eyes - it was truly amazing. The temperature drops rapidly in the early hours and you need a warm blanket - sunrise was equally spectacular with the bright red sky playing with the eyes \n\nI recommend a good walk around the island, it takes about an hour and a half - you can do this by yourself our there is a warden there who is more than happy to walk with you and point out the areas of interest - which is the rock formation and the stunning old Baobab trees - this is why people come, to see them in their glory \n\nYou won't be disappointed even if it is a pretty hard drive to get there and not to be attempted without a 4x4 ",

Dinner was traditional dishes made from fresh produce straight from the farm. Breakfast was epic - with eggs & fruit from the farm, honey from the farm bees,.. you get the idea. \n\nAn excellent option if you’re close to Francistown.",

  "text": "We stayed at Kuminda Farm for just one night (perfect location between Nata and Gaborone) with our two young children (7 and 5) and it was absolutely brilliant. We stayed in the Rondavel which was a unique experience and one we won't forget. \n\nAs many other people have said - Lucy is an incredible host and we highly recommend choosing the 'traditional food', which was utterly delicious! We were only sorry we couldn't stay longer and benefit from traditional dancing or the cooking lessons! \n\nIt was the little touches too - the flowers in the bathroom, the kids were allowed to collect the eggs from the chickens, and the company - Lucy was great to chat with! Thanks again to Lucy and Fiona and everyone else at Kuminda.",

  "text": "We spent a night at Kuminda Farm on our way from Francistown to Maun. We were travelling with our 2 teenagers. We all loved it! The chalets are very comfortable with beautiful shweshwe quilts with each chalet slightly different from the next. There are two stunning rock kopjes (small outcrops)  you can climb and you can have a walk around Lucy's amazing organic farm. The food was home grown and delicious and we were amazed to have organic blueberries in our breakfast in the middle of drought prone Botswana! Sitting around the fire under the enormous starry sky we felt completely at peace and unplugged from this troubled world. The whole place has a very genuine, authentic feel to it.  If you get a chance, stop in. You won't regret it.  Lucy's energy alone will hook you in!",

I just love the hosts especially Lucy who is so willing to go the extra mile to make sure your experience is exceptional.  Bird life and organic gardening is so informative. The traditional rooms are so clean and charismatic and the chalet with a self catering kitchen is lovely. I love the fact that there is catering or self catering as you choose or book. And if you want to camp, that's also available. Thank you Lucy for always being a gracious host  whenever we stay. Highly recommended.",

For dinner the owner, Lucy, made us a fabulous feast of local dishes, and we spend the evening outdoors by the fire with her talking about the farm and local Botswana culture.\nLucy so kindly gave us a ride from Francistown, then back the next day, and got us on the right bus to Maun.\nThanks Lucy for a great visit!",

  "text": "We stayed at Kuminda Farm in August 2016 and had the most unforgettable experience. Our hostess Lucy made us most welcome, is a wonderful cook of indigenous African food and an incredibly knowledgeable and kind conversation partner. We will never forget the evenings under the stars with her and her husband John when she gave us so much insight into the life and cultural background of the people of the area and Botswana in general. We felt more like friends than paying guests and where overwhelmed by Lucy´s hospitality. For those who want to know more she even offers meetings with local people and, in our case, a visit to the primary school of the village. Kuminda Farm is a place of unspoilt beauty with its authentic huts built and decorated by local women, basic but very clean and functional ablutions and an extremely friendly and helpful staff. We camped there with our rooftop tent and it was a perfect hideaway, absolutely recommendable for people who prefer the small and authentic places to big campsites or hotels and who appreciate a personal and special atmosphere. Thank you, Lucy!",

We stayed in a lovely thatched Rondavel, the camping area looked great too with all the facilities you would expect. Apparently they have a lot of cultural events also, unfortunately there weren't any when we stayed but looked like they would be fun. Our host Lucy has created wonderful retreat including amazing massage if you want one, (I did and it was amazing!). Go visit when your travelling through Botswana!",

She introduced us to the people in the villages and made us great meals consisting of local cuisine.\n\nWe explored her farm that had various plants and birds for the nature lover and at night we sat around a bonfire gazing into the starry night chatting the night away with a glass of wine.\n\nIt was truly a magical and very memorable experience that will always stick with us and we are very grateful to have met Lucy, such a gracious and enjoyable person, she truly adds to the experience and goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and comfortable.\n\nIf you are looking to experience Botswana in its true form, then Kuminda Farm is the ideal destination.",

  "text": "El motivo inicial de la estancia fue una parada para partir en dos días nuestro paso de Kasane a Sudafrica. Pero se acabó convirtiendo en una fantastica tarde-noche de relax, conversación y una perfecta cena tradicional, que ayudamos a preparar para pasar el rato y participar de la cocina con el equipo de Lucy. La cena consistió en ensalada, pap, panocha de maiz, salchichas y pollo, una especie de pisto y sobretodo destacar unas descomunales espinacas cocinadas con cacahuetes triturados. Nada especial, todo sencillo, pero bueno, acompañado de la conversación de Lucy, vino sudafricano y las estrellas y los ruidos de la noche. Que más se puede pedir? Nos alojamos en un chalet de 2 habitaciones, 1 baño y pequeña cocina, básico, pero limpio, en el que sólo encontramos a faltar, por decir algo, una nevera y un ventilador en las habitaciones. La ducha con poca presión, pero suficiente para ducharse. Poco más se puede decir, venir expresamente seguramente no valdría la pena, pero si te coge de camino, no lo dudes. Encantados de haber colaborado con Lucy en su proyecto, felicidades a ella y a toda su gente",

  "text": "Die Kuminda Farm liegt eine 3/4 Stunde nordwestlich von Francistown an der A 3 nach Nata. Es ist ein großes Gelände mit ein paar kleinen einfachen Häuschen. Der Bau der Chalets und Rundhütten mit Naturmaterial und die Anlage der Gärten erfolgte unter der Vorgabe der Bewahrung der vorhandenen Natur. Ein großer Biogarten liefert ständig frisches Gemüse für die Küche, aus der vorzügliche Speisen kommen - von Chefin Lucy selbst gekocht. Aus ihrer Hand stammt auch die gesamte Planung für den Bau und die Ausgestaltung der Anlage mit ihrem üppigem Baum- und Buschbestand und den kleinen Wanderwegen, in deren Mitte ein großer Felshügel mit herrlicher Aussicht auf seine Besteigung (wenige Minuten) wartet. \nSie hat sich damit einen Lebenstraum erfüllt. Lucy ist eine echte Persönlichkeit mit hoch interessantem Lebenslauf. Im Nachbarort Marabelo aufgewachsen, hat sie mit uns eine Rundfahrt in die Umgebung und in das Dorf gemacht und hat uns die Entwicklung der letzten Jahrzehnte so nahe gebracht, wie es besser nicht hätte sein können. Es war eine Freude bei und mit ihr zu Abend zu essen und ihren Erzählungen zuzuhören. Dieser Ort ist ein echter Geheimtipp - noch!",

  "text": "Ok was there back in 74 ish as a kid, deserts don't change too much. I spent around 3 nights there back then stayed near bushman settlement. They took us tracking leopard on foot, dug cool drinking water in buried ostrich eggs en route. We caught a snake too, they prepared it for eating, being about 9 I passed that opportunity.  I recall making stick den with help, living wild, bonding with those amazing people even trying their clicking language and customs. Amazing memories, please visit if in Botswana you will not regret it. ",

  "text": "We spent 7 days camping at kori and sundays pans in the CKNP and it did not disappoint. There was nothing to tell the private camps apart from the national parks camps, their amenities were identical. But the kori camps are on a through road and we had just to look up to see other campers on their game drives...showered dust on us as they passed. The Sunday camps are remote and gorgeous. Staff at the gate were friendly and welcoming. They were out of firewood to sell, which is an issue since you are not supposed to collect once in the park. Kori camps also have the unfortunate position of being near the workers camp...one could hear them at night and they drove the tractor past us four times a day. However, still one the last wilderness areas on the planet and unfenced camp sites add to the atmosphere. ",

  "text": "We stayed at the CKGR  (rooftop tent) at one of the deception valley campsites, we've been here before several years ago and found it quite rewarding for wildlife, although this time less luck, even when staying for a few hours next of one of the few waterholes.\n\nWe got appointed a campsite, but as last time, we only saw one other couple, so could (luckily) chose our site, as some had still some rubbish around, some ablutions were in bad shape, and seen it are long drops... Bucketshowers didn't work.. So, some work for the NP to bring it back in shape.\n\nIs it worth going here, hmm, difficult, it's a boring drive to get to the gate and from there it takes you again 1 hour to get to the pans, If to go, I suggest to stay for a few days..",

We had leopards nonchalantly stroll trough our unfenced campsite, met wonderful travellers from Europe and spent star spangled nights around a huge fire, with me singing songs and a special moment for me, was when I sang about the Kalahari in Afrikaans and the young lady from Austria said: \"No, we don't understand the words, but it must be a song for HERE, because I can hear the open space and solitude in your voice.\"",

  "text": "Over 10 days we travelled to 3 camps in the Okavango Delta, an area of 8,000 square km.  photo opportunities and animal encounters were extraordinary.  The experiences at each camp varied, from desert conditions to delta conditions.  From watching a herd of herds of elephants taking mud baths, watching leopards in trees and then following them on their hunts, lions roaring in the evening just next to our Land Rover; zebras, giraffes, wildebeest, warthogs, hippos, baboons, birds... We were at the Wilderness Safari camps (Kalihari Plains, Xigera and Chitabe, traveling by 12 passenger planes between the camps.  Our photo trip was arranged by Natural Habitats.  Dave Luck was an exceptional expedition leader.  Our trip had 6 travelers using two Land Rovers for each outing.  Camp staffs were exceptionally friendly with fine food and some evening native singing.  Each cabin had a large comfortable bed, shower, toilet, fan...  From a photographic vantage point, the opportunities greatly surpassed my expectations.",

Saw loads of Kalahari Lions in mating season. Loads of Oryx arriving in the Reserve. A place not for the faint hearted but luckily we were well looked after by the team of African Adventure Safaris. Ant sharing his longtime and profound experience about wildlife and the bush with us and serving every evening after a long day of doing safari a great dinner cooked at the camp fire.

  "text": "Located in the Central Kalahari Plains Reserve in Botswana, this concession stands alone. I wouldn’t think that such a remote site would be alive with so much wildlife. My husband and I were there towards the end of January, 2013. \n\nThe Kalahari Plains Camp is operated by the Wilderness Safaris tour company. We spent 3 nights here going on game drives each day. We saw Oryx, springbok, steenbok, cape fox, cheetah, elephants, black mane lions, goshawk, secretary bird and 1000s of migrating Marabou Stork, plus numerous bird species. The vast expanse of the plains is awesome to behold and teaming with wildlife.  One morning, our guide took us to Deception Valley where researchers, Mark and Delia Owens were based for 7 years, studying predators. It was here where we took a break, stretched our legs and enjoyed the beauty of the surrounding acacia trees.\n\nOur raised tent was spacious with hard wood floors and king sized bed. Bathroom was clean and spacious as well with plenty of room for my toiletries. We even had a wonderful private deck to enjoy the views of the Kalahari Plains during the midday or relax by the soaking pool. The service was excellent. I enjoyed the meals and the camaraderie of the other guests. You could charge your batteries for camera and cell phone, etc. at the main lodge. No internet. I didn’t miss it.\n\nThis Safari game trip was planned by an agent of Wilderness Safaris Company, Discover Africa located in Beachwood, OH, U.S.  Wilderness Safaris is an African based company that does not do direct booking for U.S. clients. It has its own concessions in Botswana, fleet of planes that escorted us from one concession to another. We stayed at four sites, three in Botswana and one in Zambia. The entire operation is well organized. \n\nMy husband and I are retired and travel a great deal.   I have always booked trips with group tours. This is the first time I booked a custom tour. I’m glad I did. We had all the comforts of being looked after as if on a group tour plus the enmities and service that comes with personalized attention of doing it our way. This is the best of two worlds.   ",

  "text": "An absolutely amazing trip. Spent four weeks doing a self drive from South Africa, through Kgalagadi Trans-frontier National Park, through the central Kalahari desert onto the Okavango swamps. Then through Moremi, Chobe and onto Victoria falls. Finally down the East of Botswana to the Limpopo. An incredible adventure- more game than you could imagine, spectacular sunsets, remarkable late afternoon thunderstorms, at times challenging terrain with unbelievably remote camping. Arranged to spend Christmas at a lodge namely: Tau Pan- couldn't fault it. Another wonderful break from the camping, was Stanley Safari lodge at the Falls in Zambia- a truly decadent experience! Just do it! Andy at \"Drive Botswana\" is a excellent starting point in planning a trip.",

  "text": "We stayed at the Kalahari Game Lodge and it was just the most beautiful place imaginable. Each small bungalow, with its dome shaped thatch was superbly equipped, and again the food was out of this world. The game drive was interesting because it took us to a San people's resettlement village - a very sad place, since the government has insisted that the San, or as we know them in Europe, The Bushmen of the Kalahari, no longer live their thousands of years old lifestyle, but moved them into houses. It was a sobering thought and well worth seeing for myself what it means, as I had seen these wonderful people showing their way of life on a previous trip to Botswana, and what a huge loss it is to the world that they can no longer live their own traditional way. On a brighter note, watching Meercats and watching Ground Squirrels was like stepping into a TV wildlife show and every bit as entertaining. A very memorable visit all round.",

  "text": "Definitely worth a visit . We flew from San Francisco, to London, to Johannesburg, to Maun and then to the Kalahari to Grasslands Bushmans Camp. What a journey and what a place to end up. It was perfect!  We were so tired and exhausted from traveling and it was so hot when we got there - like 115 degrees and no air conditioning. Thought we were going to die. Our hosts were welcoming but a little distant. There were only 4 other guests in camp and they were only staying one night which meant we had one night all to ourselves. The waterhole provided so much entertainment, it was like an African soap opera , always something going on but you could never be sure what to expect. So many animals, they all came to you, you did not have to go out looking for them. Our hosts warmed up and after their other guests left and we had  a very intimate experience and such a fab time.  We had the host and the whole place to ourselves, in some situations, that might not be so good, but in this case, it was fantastic. Our own private place and our own private guide.\nTien  took us out to meet the Bushmen and what a great experience. He also took us to meet the wild Dogs\n and lions that he has on his property. What a great experience. There was a full  moon while we were there and so we sat up late at nite watching all the animal activity at the waterhole\n and surrounds. \nThis is not a luxury place to stay but the food is great, the wildlife viewing is great and if its not too busy the host will be great. We had a great time. I highly recommend it.",

  "text": "I only spent two days at DeGraaff Grassland Safaris (Grassland Bushman Lodge), but it was special, and reasonably priced. Lodging consists of beautiful, spacious cottages of brick, tile, wood with thatched roofs. Food and drink were excellent. Trees around the cottages and the large meeting and dining area provide shade during mid-day. Mornings and evenings one can tour by 4WD vehicle or on foot, and see the abundant wildlife (lions and jackals, oryx and eland, kites and eagles to list but a few). Unique to Grasslands is the family's relationship with the San community, allowing a window into their knowledge of the desert plants and their cultural activities, through fascinating demonstrations. If you come to see the delta, make sure not to miss the desert, you'll be most pleased you did!",

E' una vasta distesa sabbiosa di colore rosso con piante e tanto verde, non si può paragonare al Namib, sono differenti, entrambi stupendi nella loro particolarità.\nDal nostro Lodge escursione nel pomeriggio in fuoristrada accompagnati da una guida locale e dalla nostra guida Alberto. Panorami mozzafiato, colori e sensazioni bellissime. Al tramonto spettacolare aperitivo su una duna, ricordo indelebile.",

  "text": "Partiti da Cape Town con un'auto a noleggio, abbiamo percorso miglia di chilometri fino ad arrivare nel Parco Nazionale del Kalahari.\nAttenzione: se avete intenzione di entrare nel parco, noleggiate una Jeep! So che sembra un consiglio ovvio ma i noleggiatori non si faranno scrupoli a dirvi che con qualsiasi auto si può raggiungere perché le strade sono percorribili...Bugia! Il sentiero, ovviamente , è sabbioso e se non si va con l'auto giusta si resta bloccati, come ho fatto io. Esperienza assolutamente da evitare, fidatevi sulla parola : portate kit di primo soccorso, crema solare protezione minima 30,spray contro insetti,cibo e tutta l'acqua che potete e non allontanatevi mai dall'auto .Anche se i Campi-Fortino in cui dormire segneranno il vostro nome e la vostra destinazione prossima per controllare che arriviate alla prossima tappa, non aspettatevi salvataggi cinematografici e non andate in giro dopo il tramonto, i predatori sono a caccia di notte.\nStupenda esperienza!",

  "text": "Resulto una experiencia increíble ¡ La verdad no esperaba disfrutar tanto , ni de ver tantos animales . Suerte tuvimos a raudales como no , desde que entramos ¡ según nuestro camión de deslizaba por esas tierras rojizas senti la magia de África .\n\nUn P.N.Transfrontier que hoy lo forman la unión de tres parques , una verdadera joya , tanto en paisajes desérticos fabulosos ! como en fauna sin duda . \nDesde su entrada con bonitos y bien integrados edificios , en su entorno un complejo hotelero con confortable alojamiento .\n\nFue mi primer dia de safari , que lujo por favor de abistamientos .Desde un leopardo que desde muy lejos el chofer capto a día de hoy aun no se como lo vio y la suerte de estar en el lugar y en el momento oportuno junto a la poza de agua ¡ Que maravillosa sensación verle como se aproximo a saciar su sed ....Temimos por los animales que ante su presencia formaron escuadras de proteccón , que instinto .\n\nTodo un lujo de momentos unicos sin duda , luego vendrian leónes de melena negra desperezandose y marcando territorio , oryx preciosos , springbook , aves y mangostas o familias de avestruces con su prole y tantos más .\n\nSería por la tarde de regreso cuándo tendriamos otro momento inolvidable ¡ Cinco guepardos juntos , se animan a ir de caza !!\nY ni en la mejor pasarela veriamos nada semejante , preciosos es decir poco , maravillosos y elegantes .\n\nYa de regreso seria el atardecer el que colmaria la magia de un gran dia de safari y tras un amanecer fantastico sonrei ¡ Que me depararia el segundo día , hoy os puedo asegurar que fantastico tambien .\nUn parque que colmo nuestras expectativas , bueno a falta de suricato que no tuvimos a tiro de objetivo y eso que son un simbolo en las guias , pues no los vimos .\n\nPero como quejarse si vimos los mas esquivos y dificiles , con fotos excepcionales . Fue dificil conciliar el sueño a mi retina acudian la fauna , a modo de pasarela particular y la vegetación de arbustos espinosos en flor del Kalahari .\nY un poquito de ellas comparto con el resto de viajaros , invitandoles a que vayan .",

  "text": "Проезжали через нее по trans kalahari highway из Габароне в Виндхук. Вечером. Очень запомнилось то, что есть несколько отворотов с хайвэя ко всяческим постройкам, маленьким достопримечательностям. Вдоль дороги местами растут цветы и их специально поливают, очень красиво. На пути мало трафика, поселков практически нет. Попадаются животные, особенно если свернуть с трассы на какую-нибудь параллельно идущую дорогу. Есть достопримечательность, которая нигда не отмечена в интернете: The lonely tree - это одиноко стоящий баобаб среди буша. Красивое место и какое-то нереальное, будто его там не может быть. Были там на закате, потрясающе красиво: кровавый закат и одинокий баобаб среди пустоты на много километров вокруг. Советую.",

  "text": "Sono stato 5 volte nel deserto del Kalahari, le prime due come un normale turista, poi ho incontrato il popolo dei Boscimani e tutto è cambiato. Il Kalahari senza di loro, offre una natura mozzafiato ma spoglia del vero significato di quei luoghi. Per una miniera di diamanti, il popolo dei Boscimani è stato maltrattato e costretto a lasciare la propria casa. Per me, che mi occupo di Surviving, i Boscimani sono stati i miei maestri, nativi capaci di sopravvivere in una terra tanto ostile. Il mio messaggio è: andate nel deserto del Kalahari perchè è un luogo spettacolare, unico al mondo ma pretendete di conoscere e vivere a contatto con questo popolo fiero di esistere.",

Las caminatas al amanecer y por la tarde , lo mejor , elefantes , zebras, hipopotamos , jirafas, monos, serrpientes, impalas, y hasta 2 leonas que nos hicieron asustar y mucho. Por las noches habia que quedarse dentro de la carpa porque no sabias  con que te podias encontrar afuera  y algo de razon habia porque los sonidos eran impresionantes. Obviamente volveremos",

  "text": "It’s was a longgggggg walk from our camp but totally worth it. Although we didn’t get to go to the actual Gorge we were able to trek to a beautiful scared waterfall. The water  is crystal clear and if you are lucky you might get wild figs if the monkeys don’t get to them first.It is a rocky trek so proper shoes and clothing is highly recommend. It took about an hour to and from the waterfall. The history of the Gorge is so scared that you’re not even allowed to whistle for fear of summoning the ancestors. I would totally visit again and take the 6 hour trek to the beginning of the Gorge.",

  "text": "The place is easy to reach, not very far from Palapye.\n\nThe tour guides were very good and the walk through the bush to the waterfalls was just beautiful. The water from the springs was also very pure, and natural freshness oozes everywhere.\n\nThis is a place for one to relax their mind.\n\nThe highlight of my trip was the Sir Seretse Khama alarm stone. I discovered that African traditions and beliefs are very much alike, as in Shona we actually have a saying 'Gomo rawa - meaning the mountain has fallen' which means a King has passed on, and that saying being validated by real events as in the passing on of Sir Seretse Khama made me to be a proud African.\n\nThis place has many things similar to Matobo Hills in Zimbabwe, mostly the sacredness.\n\nI feel Moremi Gorge is not fully marketed to the world as this is a proud Batswana monument.",

Need about an hour and half to go up and come down, what made the trip more exciting was that we could spot few Elands as we drove back from Gorge to the Gate!!",

  "text": "If you are visiting Old Palapye cultural site with it's great Old Church, do not miss Moremi Gorge. Deep in the forest, with water and ancient rock paintings, it is a place to remember. But, prepare for a long walk, as car has to be left long behind. If you have 4x4, you could come to the Old Palapye site, and the best is to park there. But if you come, you will face beaty of the nature in all its facets - big forest, water springs, great gorge. Breathtaking experience. ",

You are taken on a guided tour where you get to see the endangered cape vulture and other birds, hike through beautiful rock formations, waterfalls and rest at a rock believed to have rolled down a cliff the same time a famous chief died symbolizing death of a great leader. All this transmutes the experience into something completely spiritual, refreshing, tranquil and different - something fun, engaging, and deeply filled with nature.",

  "text": "We stayed just one night here. If we got back there, I would stay two, and do a lot more of the walks that are available. This is place is run by locals at a top class standard. Well worth the visit. It does pay to have a booking for a campsite. Lonley Planet was out of date with that, and the siting of the campsites. Opposite to waht Lonely Planet had. Beautiful place. If you are short of time, or not keen on a walk. Drive to the Gorge entrance.",

I walked to the 3rd waterfall and waited for my group to return which was enough and a beautiful place to enjoy nature.  \nWe saw a hyena print and heard frogs along the way, otherwise plenty of birds.\nThe guide was very informative and a must to navigate the large rocks and escarpments.

I never knew we had these amazing places right here in BW, the place is full of mysteries, and we enjoyed the tales as eloquently retold by our and amazing guide Zuma [he was  the highlight of our trip!] came here with my friends at a paltry BWP 500. The chalets, outdoor shower and the gas braai stands were rather refreshing. The gorges and ever-flowing water were inexplicably magical and the passionate Zuma made the tour extra enjoyable! I'm definitely coming back either with family or alone just to enjoy the serenity and some moments of self-reflection",

  "text": "What a magical place! Lush green forest (even in dry season). Clear running water, beautiful waterfalls and pools all year round. And rare vultures in the cliffs as well. Excellent guides who know a lot about the area and help you with some of the tricky rock climbing.\n\nTar road all the way until Moremi village then it is mainly sand which could be problem for 4x2s in the wet season. Staff at the entrance were among the most welcoming and friendly I've met in Botswana.\n\nChalets (Separate review) are excellent too",

  "text": "Just 4 hours from Gabs, this was a wonderful overnight getaway. The accommodations were beautiful--full sized bed with mosquito net, kitchenette (sink, 2 burners, refrigerator and gas grill plus dinnerware, silverware, pots/pans, strainer, spoons, tongs, rolling pin, you name it, it was in the cupboard), and bathroom with outdoor shower. The only thing that would make it better would be more privacy (we could hear every word our neighbors were saying while we were on our deck and they were on theirs).\n\nNow onto the gorge--amazing! It's so hard to believe that amid all of the winter brown in Botswana there is this little green oasis! We hiked to waterfall 5 which took us 2.5 hours round trip (with rests and stops for pictures). After that hike, we walked on the path from the chalets to reception, which was surprisingly strenuous because it's over sand. The next morning, we woke up for a 6:30 hike to see the vultures. Well-worth the early alarm! I really can't describe how beautiful it is, you'll just have to see it for yourself!",

The guide Twist was great and took us into the gorge a sacred site for the local people.  Very reasonably priced. Able to get through with two wheeled vehicle as now have bridges over river and sand is firm.  Took walks to bird hide and watched endangered vultures soaring up above. Fantastic experience.  Need to ensure that you have all your food with you as no real store in the town.  Might need 4wd in wet season.",

  "text": "A community run project, now with 6 excellently equipped chalets - outdoor showers, indoor bathroom small kitchen and gas brai/BBQ. One of the best places I have ever stayed, it felt like a real luxury outing but was only P450 (30GBP) a night for two of us.\n\nThe gorge itself is very impressive with a choice of walks from 90 mins to 5 hours. For the longer ones good shoes and some athleticism is needed. Cape Vultures add to the attraction. Guides are compulsory for the longer walks and while there is no charge a large tip is really deserved.\n\nThey are hoping to build more chalets and add a restaurant in the near future as well as introducing Zebras.",

All reasonably priced.\nThe reserve provides a guide who will take you for a walk to the gorge itself, which is really impressive. You can watch cape vultures coming and going from their nests in the gorge's vulture colony.\nZuma, our guide, was really knowledgable, pointing out the tracks of animals including python and leopard. The place has a really wild feel to it. The village of Moremi is also historically interesting ,as the whole village was moved back some years ago away from possible flood danger near the gorge itself. Your guide will tell you about it.",

  "text": "I stayed at the absolutely lovely Moremi Gorge Lodge, which is well run, amazingly quiet and an all around fantastic place to stay. Even the owner went into town the night I was there, leaving me with the crickets, the Kudu and the baboons. The approach road was a struggle, as it goes through some shallow pools, so the only way across was to drive fast enough to make it to the other side without sinking. Perhaps it would have been easier in a 4x4? Also, when they say self-catering, it is a wise man who buys his food in Palapye before he comes: food in nearby villages is expensive and poor quality, as well as being difficult to find. Still, when the accommodation is this charming, and the walk itself is this lovely, this all becomes part of the adventure.",

No accomodation in the village but suitable for a days outing from Palapye (40km away)\nTar road all the way to Moremi village where you register at the office and pay about P40 per person. A further 8km leads to the foot of the Gorge.  The 8km is suitable for 4x4 or something a bit tougher than average car.  You can safely park at the foot of the gorge where you either hike up (not too physical) or swim through the series of pools.\nA wonderful day outing.",

Mokoro safari's are departing from much further way's in the delta as they are used to, so be aware of long drive distances to get there unless you are already staying in the neighbourhood.",

  "text": "An absolutely wonderful and unique experience.  The mokomo ride through the Okavango Delta and bushman's walk was part of an itinerary designed by our travel agent and was truly one of the highlights of our 10 day trip to Botswana.  The Okavango River is absolutely beautiful.  A definite must do!\n\nAs far as the Bushman's Walk goes, the only down side was that although it was winter the sun was intense and the heat was sweltering  while we were walking (approximately 2 hours) so I can't imagine what it would be like in summer.  Just be prepared with a cap or hat to shield your face from the sun, good walking shoes and plenty of water. Fortunately, you have the option of opting out of the walk if you're not physically capable or just don't want to do it, which I would do if I did it again.  Even though we did see a lot of animals (giraffe, zebra, antelope, hippos) along the way, we had already seen them while on safari.  Several of the mokoro driver's stay back during the walk in case there are those who don't want to walk.",

I recommend booking directly with them as they provide an excellent value for money mokoro experience (much cheaper than the lodges or other organisers). They cater for all, individuals or large groups -   self catering or fully catered. These people deserve our support.

  "text": "Our 6 days on the Okavango River with Okavango River Safaris was one of the high-lights of my life!  \nWe have lived in and travelled Southern Africa for 50 years and rate Okavango River Safaris owned and run by Jacques Conradie as amongst, if not the best.\nWe have just returned from a six day Okavango Delta river safari experience which I find hard to describe - words cannot express this experience.\nWe left Maun at about 10h30 - had a wonderful lunch on an island that Ace [our guide] found - saw lots of ellies, hippos, buffalo and bird life, arriving at the camp site at about 18h00 where, Jacques, Mush and David were just finishing erecting the tents and Jackie was just finishing getting his 'kitchen' sorted out.\nThe boat was extremely comfortable [large enough to accommodate 9 passengers with ease], and had both a large canopy and ports for charging batteries - cameras etc.  Also on board was a large cooler box filled to the brim.\n\nThere followed 5 absolutely fantastic days.  The camp site, on the banks of the Okavango within the Moremi Game Reserve was wonderful - we only saw one other boat, twice - department of water affairs - and not another sole for the whole of our stay. \nReasonable size tents, very comfy beds, outdoor loo [with a decent loo seat] and a shower right behind each tent - almost on-suite, a basin and mirror alongside the tent. \n Most meals were in camp - breakfast and dinner under the open sky while most lunch was set up under a gazebo.  Other lunches were on islands and one actually in the water [table & chairs - swim, sit, eat, splash!].  The food served was absolutely fantastic - full breakfasts; lunches, one hot dish and a variety of cold meats dishes and salads with daily freshly baked bread, cheese and biscuits;  dinners - three course and the best deserts one could get in a 5 star restaurant!\nDays started with cereal & fruit, then a walk [saw quite a bit of game], back to camp for a full breakfast, then out on the boat until lunch time [or later if lunch was thus organised], after an afternoon zzzzzzzzz out on the boat again ending with sunset drinks and snacks before returning to camp for more drinks & snacks around the fire, lots of chatting, then dinner and bed were we lay listening to the lions roaring [every night - one night they passed next to the camp], ellies, [actually had them in camp the one morning], hippo's and a myriad of night birds calling.  The nights were fantastic.\n The days on the river - no words can describe the beauty of the surroundings, palm trees, enormous groves of trees,  the clarity of the water [can see every grain of sand, every plant and stem on the water base - crystal clear water], the hundreds of water lilies and other water plants the thousands of water birds [and land birds].  Many, many ellies both on land and in the water, just as many hippo's, croc's, letchwe, buffalo, impala, giraffe, wildebeest etc.  \nOur guide and host, Ace was not only one of the most knowledgeable guides that we have ever been out with, but also one of the best hosts we have had on similar trips.  In fact, all the staff were fantastic.\nThe 'pictures in my mind' of these five days will live forever.",

  "text": "HOW TO DO IT? \n\nYou can easily bypass he exorbitant prices offered by the lodges and agencies. \nThe standard price range offered by providers is 680-900p (68 - 90USD). \n\nIf we (a couple) did our overnight trip with our lodge, we would have paid 360USD. \nInstead we paid 70 USD.\n\nInstead of going with intermediaries, we went straight to Okawango Kopano Mokoro Community Trust, paid 6.8USD pppd (per person per day) fee. Next day we picked up one of their emploees in our car. He showed us the way to Mokoro Village. We were introduced to a poler there, whom we paid 20 USD per day per group, another 5 USD for having our car looked after and 2 USD pppd for mokoro seat rental :). \n\nYou will find OKMCT easily, it is in the same yard as the Helicopter Horizons (marked on google maps). \n\nIn terms of revenue, we left much more cash with the community, than we would have if we went with an agency (we would have done only a day trip for their price). The agency pays mokoro polers the 20 usd per day per group and your entry fee. The rest is transfer, in some cases food, and above all, a huge profit margin. \n\nIS IT WORTH IT? \n\nThe no-intermediary price- definitely yes. \n360 USD- not really... \n\nIf you've been to Caprivi Strip, you'd have done something similar, but having seen loads of hippos, crocs, buffaloes... Here the area is huge, reeds are dense, wildlife is scattered. We saw zebras and ostriches and only heard the hippos. \nSleeping in the wilderness, the sky full of stars, the mokoro ride itself - a beautiful experience, but for a long term traveler, definitely not worth 180 USD PP. \n\n",

  "text": "Okavango river is a major river in that it flows to the Delta that creates flooding in March and June to feed the water starved wildlife of these huge reserves in Botswana and Namibia. \n\nReaching the mouth of the Okavango in the North, we took a Mokoro boat (traditional dug-out canoe )ride to a lower down in the panhandle of the Delta.  We enjoyed the tranquility of the river.  And birdlife is prolific: egrets, Saddle-billed Stork, cranes, Scarlet-crested sunbirds to name a few.  Although we did not see much game, the boat ride was peaceful and zen like. ",

The Serondela Reserve put on its best show for us and we loved every moment of it....lions with their young, elephants playing in the river and boatrides past hippos cooling themselves in the shallow waters before turning around and warming themselves on the banks of the river.  All this and amazing sunsets too!  Definitely a highlight of our trip and we can't wait to return.",

  "text": "We had previously been to Kruger and Sabi Sand in South Africa, which we all loved.  In comparison, the herds of animals we saw here were much, much larger.  Additionally, the river provided rich and varied experiences.\n\nWe visited here on a guided overnight trip.  While we did see private vehicles, I would not recommend it.  The terrain is NOT suited to cars, and the reserve is so big, I don't know how you would know where to go.\n\nThe huge herds of elephants, hippos, cape buffalo, etc were incredible.  We also saw a group of 3 lions one day, and a group of 4 the next.  Let's not forget the absolutely magnificent leopard!\n\nThis park is incredibly sandy, and we saw both private cars and a tour jeep stuck in it.  The roads are also incredibly bumpy - like I was seriously glad I had on a sports bra; I would think twice about this if you have back issues.  The dust and heat combine to make you filthy; our one night of camping was enough - we loved it, but were super excited for a shower at the end of it.  I would not wear contacts with all that dust, either; even if you don't wear glasses, you might want to wear sunglasses while the vehicle is moving.\n\nVehicles must stay on the road here.  Please bring binoculars and a real camera (not your cellphone camera) for a much, much better experience.",

  "text": "When I first thought about visiting Chobe National Park in Botswana, I saw all of the wonderful safaris and campsites/lodges available deeper in the park. Unfortunately staying over night and spending more than a day was not going to be possible.\n\nLuckily, the day trip taken from Livingstone with Bushtracks Africa was available and so that was booked. \n\nWow!!! If that was just a sample then I can imagine how wonderful the longer safari trips could be.\nThis was a land/water day trip. We entered through the Sedudu gate near Kasana and drove on in. The red sand is beautiful as are the trees. \n\nWe started off by spotting a group of mongoose followed by impala. Those things you can't miss. They're everywhere. There's Kudu, buffalo, giraffes, elephants too and eventually a sleepy lion. In the distance we spotted a gorgeous sable antelope but it stayed away. \n\nAfter having lunch at the Chobe Safari Lodge, we cruised around the river nearby and there we spotted even more wildlife but some were a lot closer - like crocodiles, water buck, buffalo, and even some birds too. There was a nice group of elephants that decided to cross the river in front of us so many boats stayed around to watch.\n\nWant birds? The beautiful lilac breasted roller, the little bee eater, a variety of hornbills, spoonbill, ibis, the African Eagle, as well as Goliath Heron and plenty of others can be found here. If you take a day trip, be sure to ask your guide to point out some birds because they really are gorgeous. \n\nIf i came back to Botswana, I would definitely visit Chobe again and most likely for an overnight to experience sunrise, sunset, and all the parts between!",

  "text": "When we all do Botswana, we have the urge that Chobe/Serondela is just an entry point and the real places to go to are Savute, Linyanti and Moremi. I was wrong - Serondela had a lot to offer.\n\nAll the animal sightings are pretty much on the river front drive. Saw the Big 4 of the 5 (no chance of Leopards) and saw lots of Lions. The Chobe riverfront is beautiful and you must do a couple of boat trips - ideally an early morning and a sunset cruise. Not many places offer you the chance to see animals from the \"other side\" of the water.\n\nThe plus side of Serondela is that you could stay in the park or keep it cheaper and drive in from Kasane each day.\n\nGreat park, very convenient and great animal sightings on a single, not too challenging road. Only downside is that there is a fair amount of traffic from all the lodges at prime sightings.",

  "text": "I don't think there is an animal in this part of Africa that we haven't seen in the Chobe National park. Large families of elephants, prides of lions (one of them devouring recently hunted buffalo), buffalos, impalas, kudus, hippos, crocodiles, baboons, variety of birds etc, even a black mamba. While self-drive is an option, I would say that one needs a good guide to take the most out of it - our guide Laki from Chobe Bekwani was fantastic - very passionate and knowledgeable about local wildlife, he was even able to find a massive pride of lions followings their tracks. Overall, would highly recommend spending a few nights in a neighbouring lodge (we stayed in Chobe Bekwani, and it was a real treat) and to go on game drives as well as on a Chobe river boat tour. Also, Botswana is a very welcoming country, people are genuinely nice, friendly and relaxed.",

  "text": "We came here our last full day in Africa and were amazed at the number and variety of animals we saw. There were herds of elephants nearly every 20 minutes or so--some just crossing the road, others crammed under the shade of a tree, taking a bath along the side of the road, or enjoying a mud bath along the shores of the Chobe. The river supports large herds of animals, including Cape buffalo, impala, hippos, giraffes, and of course, many elephants.\n\nThe highlight of our day was seeing a pride of lions feeding on an elephant (our guide told us it had died of natural causes). There were about 6 lions patrolling what they considered their kill. Two jackals and a few vultures tried in vain to share their spoils, but they were chased away by the lions. It was as if we were watching a nature documentary, but only about 100 yards from the scene. This was one of the most exciting sights of our entire trip, which included 8 safari drives in Kruger.\n\nWe ended the day with a river cruise, where we saw many beautiful exotic birds and animals grazing on the island in the Chobe River. Chobe had a greater abundance of animals than Kruger (though we loved our time there), so if you're in the area, make it a point to visit.\n\nWe arranged the safari with our guesthouse in Livingstone, Zambia and were driven from Livingstone (45 minutes) to the border of Botswana. A 5-minute boat ride across the river will get you to your guide, who then drives you into Chobe. This was one of the best days of our African adventure and well worth the time and expense.",

  "text": "After visiting 5 parks in Southern Africa, this was my favorite. Spent the morning on a \"river\" safari. We had a \"birder\" in our group and he thought he was in \"heaven\". He was able to identify more birds in this three hour river safari than his whole previous two weeks!! Fun to observe animals on the islands and in the water especially the hippos, crocs and elephants.\nAfternoon was a land safari where we saw many more animals that 3 days in Kruger Park. 5 mins into the park we came across a leopard. This was during the heat of the day when cats are usually hard to find. Also sighted three lions. Of course, the elephants were everywhere...literally hundreds at a time. \nThe ride is a little rough, so be prepared....but so worth it!!",

  "text": "I truly think this is the greatest safari experience in Africa.  The setting, the guides, the proliferation of flora and fauna are spectacular.  The lodges range from budget (well may that's an oxymoron...they're all pricey) to extravagant.  We chose the \"mid-level\" and they were quite beautiful and sumptuous. It's best to air-hop and spend a few days at different locations to really experience this place.  you travel in open jeeps which, at first, is very unsettling as the animals are just yards away and hard to believe they won't attack you (unless you stand up).  We did have a little run in with a leopard while he was having dinner...don't do that.",

  "text": "You want to see Africa's endangered elephants? Then don't go to Serondela. They only have non-endangered elephants - plagues of them. They claim there are 120,000 elephants but I think that figure is wrong because we probably saw that many in Serondela alone.\n\nA pretty part of the park with a good diversity of wildlife. It is popular though so can get a bit crowded. For example, if you see predators you'll probably have to share it with 20 other vehicles. On the up side, your elephant encounters will be intimate.\n\nEnjoyed it a lot and would highly recommend Serondela.",

  "text": "Wir - zwei Frauen - hatten gelesen, dass nur 75 Selbstfahrer am Tag in den Chobe Park kommen und erst ab 09:00 Uhr. Allerdings waren uns die angebotenen Touren zu teuer - ab 4 Personen 100€. Nur 4 Personen finden sich nicht. Die meisten fahren selbst durch den Chobe Park. Also haben wir auch unser Glück probiert. \n\nWir waren 08:00 Uhr am Sidudu Gate und sind problemlos - mit 4x4 - rein gekommen. Der Eintritt für 2 Personen und KfZ kostete 290 Pula. Die Riverfront ist eine Einbahnstraße. Streckenweise verläuft sie auch zweispurig, so dass Gegenverkehr kein Problem ist. Mit unserem Mietwagen sind wir als absolute Anfänger gut die Riverfront entlang gefahren - 4H war ausreichend. Wir haben jede Menge Tiere gesehen: Paviane, Elefanten, Vögel, sogar Löwen aus etwas weiterer Entfernung, Antilopen/ Böcke und Nilpferde. \nWir sind bis zur Serondela Picnic Site gefahren. Nachdem die Tiere immer weniger worden, wollten wir den Ausgang Richtung Natanga nehmen. Der Weg war okay - streckenweise hatte ich dennoch 4L eingestellt. Irgendwann kam ein etwas sandiger leicht steiler Anstieg, den haben wir uns nicht getraut zu nehmen. Wir haben gewendet und wollten den Ausgang über die upper road nehmen. Katastrophe. Auch dieser Weg war machbar, jedoch schmal und zugewachsen. Nonstop sind Äste am Auto entlang geschliffen und die Äste haben uns die Spiegel umgeklappt. Übrigens sind beide Wege von absoluter Einsamkeit geprägt. Wenn etwas passiert, ist man völlig auf sich allein gestellt. Also haben wir nochmals gewendet und sind wieder Richtung Riverfront gefahren. Kurz vor der Riverfront sind wir doch noch im Sand stecken geblieben - einfach aus Unkonzentriertheit nach den vorangegangen Versuchen alternative Ausfahrten zu nehmen. Aber in der Nähe der Riverfront war das kein Problem. Dort fahren genügend Guide Touristen durch den Park, die uns geholfen haben. Der Ausgang an der Riverfront verläuft parallel zur Einbahnstraße  bzw. gabelt sich die Einbahnstraße auch ab und an in zwei Wege.\n\nAn der Riverfront an sich sind wir 2 - 2,5 Stunden bis zur Serondela Picnic Site gefahren. Die Routen sind im Park ausgeschildert. Man findet sich also gut zurecht. Eine bekannte App maps-.. zeigt auch alle Routen innerhalb der Parks an. Es war als Anfänger kein Problem die Riverfront entlang zu fahren und den parallel verlaufenden Weg Richtung Ausgang zu fahren. Traut Euch. Alles machbar - auch für Anfänger - solange man nicht Richtung Natanga fährt oder die upper road nimmt.",

No nos fuimos decepcionados en ningún excursión, y de lo contrario, cada salida nos sorprendimos, maravillados con encuentros cercanos con los animales (demasiados para nombrar acá) y aves de abundante variedad. Al contemplar los animales y aves de bien cerca, con un guía profesional que además supo de cada detalle de la naturaleza, fuimos plenamente inmersos en la naturaleza pero desde la seguridad y comodidad del vehículo. El viaje en bote que permitió observar a los animales desde el río nos dejó con avistamiento de docenas de \"Carmine Bee Eaters\" en un árbol, cosa que jamás olvidaré, más cocodrilos, hipopótamos, leones, búfalo, y aves de toda variedad.  Fue un cuento hecho realidad. Recalco la belleza del paisaje y de cada animal.  Lejos lo más lindo que he visto.",

  "text": "Faccio una premessa.. il punteggio basso che ho dato al parco non è relativo ai paesaggi, alla natura nella quale è immerso o agli animali avvistabili.. fantastici.. ma alla struttura (campsite ihaha)fatiscente, sporca,trasandata, e non curata. Il personale passa il tempo in ufficio a fare giochi con il telefonino.. mentre sarebbero da svuotare i bidoni delle immondizie che vengono prodotte dai turisti per evitare che le scimmie disperdano i sacchetti nel Bush. L'acqua calda era insufficiente, non ci sono mappe dettagliate dei percorsi effettuabili e nessun tipo di servizio minimo. Ora... il tutto diventa inaccettabile se viene richiesto un pagamento giornaliero di 30 dollari solo per entrare nel parco e di 40 dollari a testa per pernottare in piazzole inadeguate.In ultimo aggiungo che viaggiamo da anni in Africa.. e tutt'ora la stiamo attraversando con la macchina di nostra  proprietà.. questo solo per dire che non si tratta della lamentela sterile di una persona abituata al valtur.. ma di viaggiatori che conoscono piuttosto bene il continente e che sanno adeguarsi. La presa in giro e l'approfittarsi delle situazioni .. e' altra cosa però ",

  "text": "Ho visitato parchi in Namibia, in Sud Africa, in Kenya. Il Chobe è il più selvaggio di tutti. Lontano dalle rotte turistiche, più affollate, ti permette di vedere gli animali in completa solitudine. Da visitare esclusivamente con un mezzo 4x4 efficiente. Le condizioni delle piste sono peggiori che nel Kruger e nel Etosha.  Anche i panorami sono favolosi.\nUnico neo appunto le condizioni delle piste.",

Al Chobe abbiamo visto moltissimi animali: leoni, leopardi, elefanti, giraffe, zebre, impala, kudu, ippopotami, coccodrilli, bufali, facoceri, sciacalli oltre a tantissimi uccelli multicolori. Uno dei pochi animali che al Chobe non è presente è il rinoceronte. Consigliatissimo.",

C'était simplement magnifique: éléphants, girafes, hippopotames, lions, léopards, crocodiles...\nIl y a nettement plus de monde dans la zone nord, et moins dans la zone de Savuti. Dans les deux zones, ça vaut vraiment le coup de partir avec un guide avec radio: ils se communiquent les belles rencontrent, et gèrent le trafic pour éviter les embouteillages. Et bien sûr c'est un gros avantage d'avoir un 4x4 ouvert plutôt qu'une auto de location fermée!",

  "text": "I actually stopped at a nearby lodge on route north to show my family the pans. Nature is predictable so the fact that the pans were very full and very little opportunity to actually get close to them is nobody’s fault. But it was the case. We had no place to park or just sit and enjoy the pans. No birds in sight.\nThe disappointment was that we were told at the gate that a lot of “locals” were inside. There was one look out point and there were probably 50 people there. It was a massive party of people falling over themselves with bottles of alcohol in hand. It was such a disappointment as we were made to feel unwelcome and unsafe. We left. So in and out of the pans in less than an hour. P300 poorer and we can claim we have seen Sowa Pan. Not a pleasant experience at all.\n\nWe saw some Wildebeest, which you can see anywhere.\nI will never go back to the Bird Sanctuary, but if you go, then go in the week as I assume weekends are reserved for parties.\nLast I was there it was February 2019, less summer rain and in the week. Lots less people, less water and a lot more birds.",

At one point we got stuck in the salty sand and another jeep of our group pulled us out. Even though I have gotten stuck with a jeep before (in Dubai): What an experience this was for my wife! You should definitely come here and bring a lot of time and a camera!!!",

  "text": "We have booked a trip to Makgadikgadi Salt Pan with Pastor Maswanganyi from Swangs safaris as a part of our 10 day tour from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls. In the program we were promised ‘the opportunity to spend some time in the company of the local meerkat colony’.  When we have arrived to Nata lodge from where our tour should start, we were told by the local guide that we will not see the meerkat colony, because it’s 500 km away, and we will not see the sunset, which is Nata speciality, also, because the time the tour was booked for was too early. \n\nWe have learnt a bitter lesson not to trust tour organisers and check everything. Now we also know that we need to go to Planet Baobab to see the meerkats of Makgadikgadi Salt Pan, which we will definitely do during our next trip to Botswana!",

Seeing the change from small shrubby tree to seemingly endless plains of light yellow grass where cows, horses, donkeys, and native birds abound was beautiful. We travelled from Mmatshumo at the start of the wet season and would only recommend this route if you have a sturdy 4X4. We camped on Kubu Island which is absolutely worth exploring if you're already headed out this way.",

  "text": "The drive out onto the pans at sunset was a magical experience as the sky darkened from blue into pinks and golds. The pans stretched out for miles around us.\n\nAs soon as the sun was gone the biting cold crept in.  You'll need several layers of clothes, warm jacket, and a warm hat.  With these and the cosy fire and a plentiful and tasty BBQ dinner you'll be able to relax in your deck chair and admire the huge canopy of stars. It was peaceful and quiet.  A chance to get away from everything else.\n\nWe were provided with very comfortable beds - they each had a waterproof canvas outer, and inside was a thick mattress, sheets, warm duvet and a hot water bottle (with water heated up on the camp fire). Lovely.  I didn't get cold at all during the night.\n\nThere was a breakfast of hot tea and muffins, which was served at dawn around the fire.\n\nWe did this tour of the salt pans from Planet Baobab.  It was almost a 2 hour, bumpy drive in a 4WD from there. We didn't see a lot of animals along the way but saw several birds.  \n\nA top highlight was the visit to the meerkats  Amazing experience to be able to get so close to them and walk alongside them as they made their way back to their den.  They were aware of us but seemed not to be bothered by our presence. After that, it was a short quad bike ride for around 15 minutes on the salt pans.  Two people per quad bike, which is not ideal for safety.  However, you can stay in the 4WD vehicle if you wish. Bring a scarf to cover your mouth and nose from the dust while on the bikes.\n\nDon't miss this trip.",

  "text": "Our travel agents booked through Gweta Lodge, which was where we set off from. We stopped a couple of times on route to look at boabao trees, termite mounds and meerkats. All were interesting but nothing compared to the pan. \n\nIt was the most surreal experience. Sat there in the vast nothingness, waiting for the sunset sipping a beer. There were just three of us and a staff of 4! so we really felt we had a vast area to ourselves. I think it would be different with a bigger group (certainly noiseier). Sleeping without a tent under big african skies was truly memorable. I have never seen as many stars. \n\nIf you are anywhere near this part of Botswana go on a trip that lets you sleep on the pan (not all do). It was worth every penny.",

  "text": "Not to be confused with its \"sister park\" Nxai Pan (though technically, Nxai Pan is part of Makgadikgadi, apparently)--which was awesome--Makgadikgadi Salt Pan NP was \"littered\" with dead animals. \n\nI understand death is part of nature, and how many of us who go on safari are even hoping to see death in some fashion (say, a kill, perhaps? Or at least big cats feasting on a kill). But here? In a half-day's worth of driving--starting at the entrance closest to the entrance for Nxai Pan (I forget the name), but not going to the pans, as they were too far away--we came across: 1 dead wildebeest, 2 dead cows (yes, cattle graze down by the river), and 7--seven--dead zebras. \n\nAgain, I get that not everything one sees while game driving is going to be alive, but this much death in a relatively small space? Something strange was definitely taking place, and it made the park really eerie. Also, at some point, it's nice to see something actually living. (We did see one bull ele down by the river, which was good). \n\nThe signage was confusing, we saw more dead animals than living animals, and the whole place was just kind of creepy and weird. \n\nI suppose if you go to the pans themselves, and during the zebra migration or perhaps another time of year, this park could be cool, but our experience was sort of the opposite. \n\nThe good thing is, since it's part of Nxai Pan as well, one payment gets you into both reserves--and Nxai Pan was fantastic.",

The grey, dry soil going for miles and miles in the winter (September) was interesting to see but not a touch on the rest of Botswana (Chobe, Khama etc.). We are not into camping, so our hosts decided against Kubu Island and it was the wrong time of year for the large flocks and herds. We saw one lesser flamingo on a little pond beyond the grey Sowa Pan, but the pans themselves were dry and barren. \n\nAn interesting site - but not one to spend too much time on at that time of year.",

There are some DONTs, such as \"stay on the visible tracks\", will allow you to visit the two incredible Islands, in the middle of nowhere. Kekonje has no facilities at all- but that suits us 100, Kubu, unfortunately has become a hotspot, money is demanded to visit, ablutions (long drops) are disgusting. but never the less, we will and continue to make this a regular stop and visit (we found other campsites, which are far more attractive and friendly)",

  "text": "Honestly when coming in botswana too many people pass this amazing desert and it is in my opinion a huge mistake! The landscapes are amazing, very unique and allows to have a really different experience during the trip in Botswana. It is simple it was our best experience in this country. Landscapes are totally surrealistic, you can see the meerkats, the San bushmen, endemic animals like hyena, depending on the month you go there you may see the migration, in October we saw just the begining. It is fantastic and totally worth to spend 4 or 5 days there",

  "text": "Fortunately, we asked about the conditions of the pans at Gweta Lodge before heading to Lekubu island. The guy told us that the pans are still wet if you try to reach them via Gweta. Therefore, we took the alternative route about 15km before Nata. He also told us that they pulled out a car the other day and it took them 14 hours for the recovery and that two other cars were in too deep so they had to abandon them. For more information, watch the Top Gear Botswana Special (S10E04).",

We played a little game of trying to walk back to our ATV's blindfolded. It's amazing that how much we depend on our sight to correct our shortcomings. Everyone's step is biased either left or right. I managed to walk relatively straight, but some others literally walked in circles. We had our sundowner drinks there and were treated to a beautiful sunset!

  "text": "We booked our overnight excursion to the Salt Pans through the Gweta Lodge. The Gweta Lodge is a beautiful place. In the afternoon we were driven to the salt pans in a game drive vehicle. On the way we stopped at a massive Baobab Tree and also got to stop and watch the meerkats. The guides dropped us off on the edge of the pan and we walked to our camp site - it's like walking on the moon. The guides built us a fire and prepared dinner. We got a sleep on mattresses directly on the pans - without tents - so we could see the stars all night. In the morning the staff prepared breakfast and afterwards we drove back to the Gweta Lodge. It is definitely one of the best things I did in Botswana - would highly recommend.",

If we drove ourselves, we never would have seen so many animals.  Our guide got us to see  a leopard (3x and once with a kill), zebra, elephants, giraffe, a wild dog, a hyena, and a lioness in the tall grasses with her 3 small cubs.  Great place to view amazing animals.",

Until we visited the Khwai river and camped at the Hippo Pool with Walk Botswana.

And there were also many lions, some of whom visited our camp, and an array of other animals and birds. Great place, though our guide thought it was quieter than usual for wildlife!",

  "text": "Visited with Sango safari camp in late December, and had some fantastic sightings including large groups of elephants, lions (including some that had climbed a tree which was pretty crazy), wild dogs, and an absolutely beautiful group of denning hyenas with their pups (easily 15+ of them).\n\nThe denning hyenas have dug a spot right in the middle of the road so you're able to get really close to them (some of the pups were even gnawing on a tire of one of the trucks) and we've heard they're there pretty much every year (unless something gets really off with the weather one year) so they are really amazing to check out.\n\nThe park is really green this time of year so would recommend a guide to support your spotting and also so they can coordinate with the guides from the other camps. The cars are able to go off-road here which helps as well in the rainy season so that you can get closer to the sightings when you do find them.",

Many of the Camps are in the concession, not in the GP, which is separated from the concession by a river. You find very unique spots there: A Hyena den in a collapsed termite hill which hosted a lot of families of hyena at a time. A Mokoro spot where I was surrounded 275 degrees by elephant coming 20m to the car. Very unique plalce with the same wildlife as Moremi. \n\nAs anywhere in Botswana: Check time when you go there as scenery and wildlife differs a lot within the year. \n\nDefinitely going back.

One thing we hadn't appreciated was that travelling at this time of year the morning drives are COLD.  We layered up and were provided with thick ponchos, blankets and \"bush babies\", (hot water bottles) so were really warm but do take hats and gloves.  ",

  "text": "There is no doubt that this is something of a hidden treasure. It is not easy to get to - a long and corrugated 60 miles from Letlhakane - but worth the effort.  On arrival in mid April there were only 3 other couples in the whole park. Over 6 days we only saw 3 other vehicles, but 26+ elephants, 8 lions, herds of springbok, family groups of kudu, hartebeest, wildebeest, giraffe, ostrich and dozens of bird types.\n\nIt’s a bit of a palaver booking and paying. The camps within the reserve ar administered by Bigfoot Safaris and need to be booked prior to arrival. Entry to the park is controlled by DWNP and must be booked ahead and paid for on arrival (in cash!)  \nBecause we were travelling and had little airtime and spotty wifi we managed to arrange to pay Bigfoot over the phone but DWNP required a meeting with a ranger in a Choppies carpark upon our return.\n\nWe stayed in Molosi 01 and Maleswe 02.  Both camps are close to pumped waterholes. You can see the waterhole from Maleswe and are on the elephant commuter route to/from at Molosi (where elephants had wrecked the bucket shower and tried to push over the latrine.  But hey! That’s what you’re paying for.",

  "text": "We travelled up to Khutse in June 2019 from Durban and stayed at Molose for 3 nights, and then at Mahurushele for 2 nights. The park itself was just as we’d hoped – Adventurous and Wild!\n\nYou need to take everything with you – which includes enough water and supplies, as well as petrol/ diesel, and other necessities like wood/charcoal etc (You might not see another person/ car for a few days – at one stage we went 3 days without seeing another vehicle!). At the campsites there is just a long drop and no running water, with a bucket shower if you take your own water.\n\nWe weren’t experienced 4X4’ers and took an Isuzu 4X2 which still dealt decently with the sandy roads. We did get stuck once and needed to dig ourselves out which took about an hour – lucky we took a shovel! Most of the roads were fine for a 4X2, with a few sandy patches which were a bit dicey but which we managed to get through.\nI’d definitely recommend taking a shovel and closed walking shoes with you in the car, in case you either need to dig yourselves out, or need to walk if your car breaks down etc. However it was encouraging to see that the parks officials did track visitors when they were expected to leave the park and will come find people if they haven’t left on the date they’re supposed to.\n\nIn terms of the animals we unfortunately didn’t see as many as expected. The pump at the Molose watering hole had been broken by elephants about a month before we visited. We still did see tons of elephants and springbok (21 springbok each day for 3 days to be exact – which clearly meant there weren’t many predators around). The only predators we saw were bat-eared foxed and a rogue African Wild cat near our campsite. The best camp for animals appeared to have been Khutse Pan where there was lots of open veldt and an open waterhole (this is close to the park fence but appeared to be the best place to stay in terms of looking for animals). \n\nOverall, even though we were disappointed with not seeing many animals, it was an amazing experience!",

  "text": "We stayed here on one of the Khutse pan campsites, two nights. At the campsite was just a pit toilet and an enclosure for shower, no water. Most of the spots didn´t have any big trees for shade. There were no other visitors, so we had the whole place for ourselves. That was nice and gave a feeling of remoteness. We really loved it there, though would have liked to see more animals, we just saw some antelopes and birds and one jackal and a wild cat in two days. There was some water at the nearby waterhole at the Khutse pan, so I wonder why such a lack of animals. Staff at the gate were very friendly. I would recommend this place for those who want to enjoy wild nature not seeing many other people, and those who are ok with not to see so many animals.",

  "text": "Been planning the trip for about 3 weeks, after making the booking through Bigfoot Safaris and Tours in Gaborone, we eagerly traveled the 260km (100km gravel/sand) to Khutse. Unfortunately we couldn't get the same campsite for 2 consecutive nights as all camps were already booked was which was a pain as it necessitated a move, which meant build camp, break camp, build camp, break camp. As it happened we later found out that the weekend was completely sold out due to a SA public holiday. But in the end the change of scenery was nice. But definitely wont attempt this in summer.\nDay 1 was at Molose 4 - very clean and neat and quiet, as it is well away from the other 3 campsites in the area. \nWe went down to the waterhole for sunset and sun downers and to hopefully see some game, unfortunately what we saw was pretty shocking, 2 separate groups of SA reg groups parked alongside the waterhole on both sides out of their vehicles sitting on camp chairs with their tables and braais in full swing. That wasn't even the most shocking. The 1 group allowed their 3 children clearly under 10yrs of age to play at least 30mt from them, nearer the waterhole... All I could think was these people must have rocks for brains or perhaps they thought they were at the Vaal dam for the weekend. The other group were not much better as they too were sitting and standing around their bar table completely oblivious to the fact that they were in the Kalahari in a wildlife reserve in a lion area with confirmed sightings of lion at that waterhole for the past 7 days. Besides the fact that none of the prey animals would ever come close to the water with them there so what they were hoping to see there amazed me. The thirsty giraffe stood about 1000m away before eventually moving off. Needless to say we also moved on and found somewhere else to watch the beautiful Kalahari sunset. After a delicious BBQ dinner by the fire we were treated to the most spectacular star filled sky that I have ever seen in my life, made possible by a moonless night. \nWe had chilly good night sleep and after making our \"amarula\" coffee and still in our PJ's we took a quick drive to the waterhole to see the sunrise, and perhaps an animal or two - although we beat the masses there, it was not long before they arrived to set up camp against the waterhole and started their Gas cookers to boil the water for coffee. We didn't hang around and went back to camp to have breakfast and break down camp to move across to Khutse Camp #9 - Also nice and clean and the previous campers had left us a log of firewood (standard camping etiquette) this campsite has a beautiful large acacia tree. Toilet was Clean and Bucket shower was working. Resident mongoose paid us a visit and the Hornbills made us feel welcome. Khutse pan has large numbers of springbok and we saw a family of 8-10 Black backed Jackal there too.\nAfter another great sunset and a BBQ dinner we sat around the campfire and admired the awesome night sky. We had a cold night but slept well, and only woke up once in the early hours to hear the lion roaring in the distance. The Jackals woke us up properly though at around 5.30am but we didn't mind, and were soon up to make coffee and tea for our early morning sunrise drive. We decided to head north to one of the pans close by, and were so happy we did as rounding a corner we were met by a Cheetah Female and her two 4-6 week old cubs. First Cheetah sighting in the real wild! excluding private reserves and Game parks. This was the real deal! \nSo our final Game sighting List included: Elephant (a new and welcome addition to Khutse)/ Giraffe/ Red Hartebeest / Gemsbok / Kudu / Jackal / Steenbok / Sprinbok / Ostrich & Cheetah. Many Birds including quite a few raptors which is always nice.\nWhat you need to remember to take: Plenty Water (drinking and bathing) / Firewood / Good Camera / Binoculars are essential / Bird and other reference books, besides all your usual camp equipment. \nWe can't wait to head back, only this time we will avoid SA long weekends as it seems Khutse is becoming very popular with our SA neighbors. We don't really mind them as long as they respect the rules and laws of Nature - it would be very sad to hear someone or someones' child became a statistic of the food chain, and what the repercussions of that might be...Until the next time!",

  "text": "We stayed here for 6 nights and in that time only saw 5 vehicles!  There had been plenty of rain in February and March so the grass was high so you only saw animals on, or very close to, the tracks or at the pans.  We stayed at 3 different campsite, Moreswe, Molose and Khutse. \nYou have to be prepared to take everything with you (including water) as the only facilities at campsite are a long drop toilet, bucket shower and a fire pit.  We were glad that we's taken our own 12 volt shower as at two of the sites the bucket showers were broken. It's 100 km of reasonable gravel from the nearest town, Lethlakeng, and then sandy tracks in the Reserve - the 70 m from the gate to Moreswe took us about 2 1/4 hours. \nWe enjoyed seeing animals at Moreswe Pan and Khutse Pan but especially  loved being back I the bush on our own.",

  "text": "What a place to go and visit if you don't want to see any people for days -- if you lucky -- or just a vehicle or two.\n\nBooking through Bigfoot tours - google them - and speak to Lucia, she has always been helpful in the past times we went camping in Khutse. \n\nGo for at least 3 nights as that will be worth your while to enjoy the emptiness. Stargazing is spectacular on a moonless evening and you don't need any light when it is full moon. You can hear the planes going over from Europe to give an idea of how quiet it does get.\n\nCamped at Mahurushule / Khutse / Khanke / Moreswe and each of these have a pit latrine and a place where you can hang your shower or use the bucket that is supplied. Khutse pan campsites can be a bit noisy if there are other people as the noise does carry far on a silent evening. Make sure you do douse your fire every night to avoid it spreading into the veld and cover it with sand, bury the ash before you leave to give your fellow campers a nice experience.\n\nFirewood / water and fuel is essential and you need to ensure you have this to be self sufficient for the time that you are in the reserve. Take your rubbish back with you and discard it at the gate. The road from Lethlakeng could be either dusty and rough of wet and slippery, depend on the time of year that you visit.\n\nSome spots to go for a viewing is Khutse Pan / Moreswe Pan (far south of the park) / Molose waterhole. You can see lion / wild dog / elephant / springbuck / duiker / giraffe and then if you do take some time, good spot for birding - owls / eagles / vultures and a big variety of predatory and other birds.\n\nGreat break-away spot for a long week-end, closest place to Gaborone and a similar experience as CKGR. Bush camping at its best.",

  "text": "As a Botswana resident, be advised that Khutse is not for the first time safari-goer. The main access road from the capital can be poor, with severe corrugations. Game can be sparse. There are virtually no facilities and you must be self-sufficient in water, fuel and food for the duration of your trip (including a reserve), and you MUST take your rubbish back to the gate with you when you leave. You are not permitted to collect firewood in the reserve so this must be obtained in advance and carried in with you. You will need your own camping equipment and a strong 4x4 vehicle and a sense of adventure. You need to book in advance through Big Foot Tours (Google them) who can also organise payment of park fees to the Department of Wildlife on your behalf. Regard your trip there as primarily a wilderness camping experience and you're unikely to be disappointed. You COULD see lion, leopard, cheetah, wild dog or you might see none of them. All of them are free to wander into your campsite at any time, so be vigilant and watch your kids (or leave them at home). I have been there dozens of times and it is brilliant, provided you come properly prepared and with realistic expectations. Plan your visit for at least 3 nights to make the journey there worthwhile.",

We went on a day visit to Khutse and CKGR, we had 4x4 but never had to use the 4x4 feature, we we lucky on the day, we saw lions, cheaters, Ostriches, Springboks, Giraffes, Gemsboks and other popular antelopes found in Khutse",

  "text": "They seem to want you to have reservations, but the people I was traveling with (who had lived in Botswana) couldn't figure out how to make those required reservations. We went, were told we couldn't have a reservation. They were \"full\". There were no other cars, no indication anyone else was there....we asked if we could go in and they again said we could not have a reservation, but this time they added that we could have admission. I have no idea what all happened there. Maybe the fee we paid went in someone's pocket. We saw some animals, but not too many. Their sign implies there are more animals to see than there are, for example there's a zebra on the sign but none in the park.",

  "text": "Khutse is one of my favorite spot for a short wilderness trip from Gaborone, the capital city of Botswana. Game is bit less dense here and the landscape is typical karoo bushes. Park has got mainly three waterholes where the animals frequent. I have spotted lions but no other cats though they say Cheetahs can be spotted at times.\n\nOther games are also low, you may find antelopes like, Hartebeest, Zebras, Oryx, few Giraffes etc. Birds like Vultures, Rollers, Kites and Eagles can be seen.\n\nKhutse is a very good park for a quick break from your routine days at Gabs and a one night camping would be great. The camps have only Pit /long drop Latrines and must carry enough water for your stay. Camp sites are not fences and predators are free to roam, its not advisable for the little kids to play around unattended.",

  "text": "Khutse is a great game reserve that is about 3-4 hours from Gabz.  It is hit and miss on the sightings front but when it is good, its great.  When it is not giving you the predators (lion, leopard, wild dog, caracal, hyena typically) just enjoy the birding and plains game, and of course being in the bush.  You need to be fully self sufficient as the campsites don't have water provided.  You do get a loo and a bucket shower.  Moonless nights result in some of the best star gazing you will experience.  Big Foot Tours are who you book the campsite through.",

  "text": "We were lucky to have camped at Khutse in our last few days in Botswana. The drive on the dirt road itself was interesting as there is hardly a person  you'll get to see after a while.We stopped over at a place to have quick lunch and as we were having our lunch, there came some bushmen...they were nothing like how we see in the movies, they were wearing T-shirts and capris, women in skirts, but clothes were shabby. As we had no language to communicate, we just smiled at each other and we ended up sharing our pasta and coke with them!\n Khutse is a lot drier than game reserves up north like Chobe and Maun. Nevertheless, this place still has plenty of lions. Lovers of the big cats, as we are, we have no reasons to regret our visit to this place. There are areas of clearings interspersed with areas of bush.Spotting game in bush is not all that easy but as we had visited in november, it was hot and we spotted game at the water holes.We spotted giraffes, springboks, gemsboks and kudus but the most memorable was a lioness walking on the road with her two little cubs, it was absolutely adorable and she continued walking on the road in spite of our presence, for pretty long! Other than that we spotted some six different lions and lionesses at various locations in the reserve, which was a lot more than our expectations!. We went with our group of friends to camp there. We were allotted a nice camp site,with a single tree in the centre and a pit type toilet. Day was pretty hot but it became cooler by the time we pitched our tents in the evening. We had a nice barbecue and a wonderful farewell party with the only music being the sounds of the jungle. After we slept, it drizzled and to our thrill, when we got up, we saw lion pug marks over the freshly drizzled soil right on our camp site! We were all so excited with the idea of a lion visiting us while we were asleep!\n\nAgain, a few things which must be kept in mind before planning is that you must have a four wheel drive to reach this place, as its almost a 100 Km of dirt road from lethlakeng. Its better if you have at least two vehicles for backup in case of a breakdown which had happened here with another of my friend. The last fuel station is at lethlakeng, so carrying extra fuel is a good idea and so is carrying everything you need to eat and drink. Not many people come to camp here, so it gets rather lonely, like we were the only people to camp in the whole reserve when we went. So, again, its better to travel in a group than a couple alone or something.There is a resort a few Km short of this place, but I have no idea about how it is. Overall,an interesting place to camp for a thrill seeker but not a place for the faint hearted!",

  "text": "We spent just one night camping in Khutse, but it was a real adventure for us. It took us over 6 hours to get to Khutse from Gabs due to construction past Molepolole (hopefully completed by now as we went in September 2014) and the quality of the dirt road (our vehicle lacks rear shocks).\n\nYou're required to have a 4x4 to enter the park (they will ask at reception) and you're going to want a vehicle with decent clearance as the ruts in the sand are deep. Don't be stupid like we were and take your Rav4 Jr or you'll probably get stuck. Miraculously we didn't, but if we had, we would have been stuck for awhile since there was only 1 other group in the entire park. Ideally, go with a group and 2 vehicles. Be sure to pack extra petrol/food/water just in case. Also, bring your own firewood because we didn't find anyone selling alongside the road, so after sunset, we had nothing to do but go to sleep. \n\nWe stayed at Mahurushele Pan #3 and it was a great camping site under a big tree. We walked to the pan for sunrise/sunset and had a lovely view of grazers and birds (Kori Bustard/Secretary bird). We would have like to have stayed at Molose or Moreswe to watch the watering holes, but we couldn't make it that far in our vehicle. We listened to the birds sing us to sleep and woke up to something sniffing/breathing outside of our tent (likely a hyena, but we didn't look). This was my first time camping anywhere with large animals and it evoked a fair bit of anxiety (I've since camped in Chobe & Khama Rhino Sanctuary, and ever time, it's a bit tense). We didn't see any predators, but we didn't feel bad because no one had seen anything except hyena in the past week. Check the log book at the entrance to see what people have been seeing.\n\nAll in all, we had an enjoyable trip. We both decided it was worth it for the Kalahari sunrise/sunset over the pans! I'm not sure we'll have time to go to the CKGR, so I'm glad we made it to Khutse!",

  "text": "Are you a nature lover to an extent where you can drive on your own, camp, live, eat and be close amongst wildlife rather than sleep in luxurious chalets and go game driving with managed groups? Do you like wildlife as they are suppose to be. i.e wild? Do you want to enjoy Africa a little differently from the usual style? \n\nTHEN KHUTSE IS YOUR BEST & QUICKEST BET (Located less than 250kms from Gaborone, the capital city of Botswana)\n\nI am indeed proud and happy that i have included this marvel which is home for 1000s of wildlife lovers when they want a get away from Gaborone or those 4x4 enthusiasts who wanna pass through the Mighty Central Kgalagadi Game Reserve. Khutse will be their 1st stop. \n\nA rustic game reserve located about 100kms from the last filling station point & big village called Letlhakeng, Khutse Game Reserve was once part of the CKGR. It was later separated for better management i should guess, else CKGR which is now the 2nd largest wildlife reserve int he world, would have been 1st largest wildlife thanks Khutse made separate. Yellow Stone of USA takes the 1st position but i can guarantee that the wildlife and action that happens here is unmatchable.\n\nKhutse, a relatively small game reserve is packed with adventure if you go at the right time of the year and to the right camping sites. The booking is currently done via a private tour company located in the capital city (a simple googling will take you to Bigfoot tours) and they give enough info about the park and also help you hire vehicles to drive in (its a strictly 4x4 zone and you need a little bit of driving skills to handle the mixed terrain which starts with gravel from Letlhakeng (about 110kms to Khutse) and then completely loose desert sand throughout the park.\n\nLions are the big cats found quite often here while Khutse is also home for Cheetahs and Leopards but quite small in number. Khutse boasts of many campsites but my personal favorite and mostly in demand site is Molose. It has about 4 campsites of which one located very very close to the famous Molse Pan & Waterhole. A pride of 17 lions are currently hanging around in this area and if you are lucky, you can spot them drinking water at Molose. \n\nKhutse is also home for several species of birds, other mammals such as Hyena (both Brown & Spotted), Bat eared fox, caracal, jackal, and some types of snakes too.\n\nIn my 9 visits to Khutse i have seen Lion only once as i always go on crowded long weekends where most campsites are full. Rainy time is not the best time to visit due to road conditions and little chances of seeing animals. Best time is Sep/October when its dry and not raining much. Or around February when the rain gradually reduces but it still hot. Why, because the animals come closer to the waterhole during dryer periods.\n\nBut that doesnt restrict a camping experience in the wild so if you don't have choice, Khutse is still worth a visit once anytime. Highly advised to go with adequate water, food, medication and other requirements as there is no connectivity whatsoever and just peace.\n\nThere are loads of information in web portals about Khutse & camping in general in that area. Hope this information is helpful and please ensure that you have a 4x4 and try avoiding going in just 1 vehicle so that if you are stuck inside the 2nd vehicle can assist.\n\nThanks",

Пригнали джип - только гид и мы - несколько часов катались по Калахари, смотрели разных антилоп и птиц, бегали за некоторыми и много фотографировали. Слегка замерзли, но было очень классно! =) Надо учитывать, вы едете искать животных, а не смотреть их. Это не зоопарк.",

  "text": "We were actually at Moremi  in May, at the end of their dry season before the rains come.  We thought it might be easier to see the animals when there were fewer places for water, but our guide told us that regardless of the time of year, there is plenty of animals to see...and boy, was he right!  We were there for three days, so we had a total of 6 drives and on each drive we had an amazing experience.  From early morning lion kills of a zebra to the late afternoon elephant family playing with their kids in the mud, the viewing was some of the best we've ever had.  Definitely will be going back!!",

  "text": "I have already experienced Botswana parks in the past  but never Moremi before: well  it is really  wonderful, not only for the high number of animals we were able to watch but  mainly beacuse they were very close to us and the surronding landscape  was amazing: colors, trees, water pools. Moreover it is the first time that I see a total of 15 lions in the same day ( 1 big group of 7 and  smaller of 2/3 each).  Apart from the natural beauty of the park itself  our guide  did a great job ckecking  all the  remote corners and following the footprints left by cats on the ground.  I am pretty sure that he made the difference",

  "text": "Moremi Game reserve is a part of the Okavango Delta. Normally it is one of the greenest and water holding part of Botwana but due a lack of rainfall last summer there was less water than usual this time of year. Due this reason the roads are very dry and have become deep sand on many places so a 4x4 is really needed. Reduced tire pressure is obligated. The NR is rich of wildlife and entry is swift when prebooked and entry fees already paid at the bureau in Maun.",

  "text": "The Khwai area of the Okavango lies along the northern boundary of the Moremi Game Reserve. This is an unfenced\nboundary allowing wildlife to move freely between the woodlands in the wet season when water is plentiful and back to permanent rivers and lagoons in the dry season. The Khwai area offers the same wildlife experience as the reserve with the added advantage of being a private concession which means the ability to do walking safaris and night drives.\nThe waterways are home to numbers of hippo and crocodiles as well as a multitude of waterbirds. Other birding opportunities are spectacular, with a list of 450 recorded species in the area.",

It was worth the pain. I saw my first leopard, a female hunting Impala. The sighting was close and for about 10 minutes.\nWe saw many giraffe, lions, hippos and dozens of elephant. Our guides were terrific.\nSnacks and lunch were welcome.\nHighly recommended.",

  "text": "Do not expect too much from the animal kingdom. The place is huge and it takes time to discover. The north-west part is almost crowded, but there are still areas where you can drive for hours without seeing another car. The experience depends complete on the weather / climat. This yeas it is bone dry - a lot of roads are passable which normally have too much water. The main roads consist almost entirely of deep, fine sand. Positiv: the main roads were graded in June this year. Well done! Is it worth? I personally like the Khwai area much more. ",

It is beautiful, at times the lions were close enough to reach out and touch.  We went to sleep being able to hear the elephants stomachs growl.  There was a leopard sighting, but sadly not by us.  The Wild dogs were magnificent.  Take your provisions - the odd shop has basics that will cost you.",

Lots..and I mean lots of animals, many close encounters especially with the elephant! A must do is a guided boat trip on the delta, which is available in camp. If there is one place in Botswana we can highlight it is Moremi!\nOn a negative only is the ladies at reception of South gate is quite arrogant, but if you look past that a altogether amazing experience!",

Da wirt's mit einem Tag schon knapp.\n\nTrotz alle dem ein sehr empfehlenswerter Park um seine Liste der big Five zu verfollständigen oder einfach mal einen Tag auf Pirschfahrt zu gehen.",

  "text": "If you like vintage this is the park for you. Time stod still here, the rides are very old and one would wonder about security . Very small kids were riding , terrified!!! No age restriction??? .Not  all were working. Bigger kids seemed to have fun since I guess thats the best there is to find here.  I read good reviews about the rides, I guess there are from people that never experienced anything better. Those rides would never be allowed in Europe. We sow to lions.Lots of kids in the pools, water is low, 2-3 water rides that kids seem to enjoy",

  "text": "The lions are the best attraction there! They are so big, well fed. Rollercoaster and wave pool was fun. Price affordable.\nAfter visiting other theme parks around the world, I can see the kids rides are unsafe. The teacup ride and Dumbo ride need safety chains so the kids don't fall out. Can't expect a kid not to try and stand up. Especially that the staff said it was safe for my 1 yr to go on the ride alone??? They need stricter age restrictions or I can see a litigation in the future.",

I love the idea of it being in a bush as it gives it that “the best of both worlds” feel. It’s also very close to Gabs and the roads are good now with less traffic in and out of Gabs. I would recommend taking note of the times for being on certain rides or viewing times for lions as we ended up not seeing the lions because we missed the viewing times.",

Gaborone is hot especially in summer so the pool with slide is awesome. For adults I recommend the roller coaster and paintball. You can also have braai or barberque. Its the perfect family spot with everything for everyone. They used to have horses next door but unfortunately there are no longer there.",

  "text": "We took a day trip to Lion Park resort with the hope of spending a fun family day out. We were happy to be offered a “Winter Special” discount and managed to save on the entry fee. However we were disappointed to see that half of the rides were not working including the main water slide which “did not have water supply”. The rides looked old and worn out and the place rather quiet with limited catering although you are allowed to bring your own food for a fee. Notwithstanding this we enjoyed seeing the lion though. It was generally a very disappointing outing. This place does have the potential to better if management invests in repair and rehabilitation of the rides and general facilities. ",

The evening braai was not a braai at all but just dinner. This should be improved. because we were the only people there a bit of music would have not been bad. otherwise the place is very accommodating as some of my collogues say they left the place very late but no one bothered them.",

  "text": "I have been to this place several times in my 20 years of Gaborone life and Lion's park just 15 km from Gaborone.\nEventhough a lot of additions have been made over the years i hav always enjoyed this place where you can go with your gamily and friends even before as there are not a lot of places like this in Botswana.The entrance fee is very reasonable and you dont need to pay anything inside for the different type of rides/ games you play. You are tied a band which is valid for a day so if you want you can go out and come in any number of yimes within that day so we being vegetarians we cook and take our food and go around 10 as soon as its open spend a lot of time in valley of waves where every 25 minutes there is an artificial wave which is really excellent  (very smaller version of sun city's valley of waves) and hav lunch in our car around 1 in the afternoon and then go back enjoy different games and leave by 6pm.Even though all rides are interesting the roller coaster and valley of waves and the other one which you walk to the top and come throgh a open tunnel in a zig zag manner and finally land into the water are three most interesting ones.Of course to see the lion also is interesting.\nThere is nice bar and coffee shop and icecream shops as well as the ice creams sold in 3 wheels also. It is a lovely place to see.",

  "text": "The park has quite a number of games. The train ride is good for family and takes you around the park. The roller coaster is so crazy, the minute it departed from the platform I knew I made a mistake being on board! but with a couple of minutes ( which seemed like forever) it was all over.\n\nThe place is like 15 mins outside town. The road leading to the facility needs to be upgraded and so is the parking. Staff is always ready to assist and speak English too. There is a bonus of viewing lions in the premise. However they were just sleeping the whole time , no matter the screams we threw at them.\nOverall, this is a fantastic park to take the kids for fun.",

  "text": "Our family visited Lion Park to give the children something enjoyable to do for their mid-term break. It wasn’t the first time that we visited the park (we always enjoy it there), but what I want to emphasize with this review is the amazing friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. When we arrived there wasn’t a table available for us, due to a conference being hosted. The waitress promptly organized a table  -  being very friendly the whole time. Later the day (around 12o clock) we went to see the lions. The guide cheerfully answered all our questions, made jokes, (even giving us more information about wildlife in general) and made the short trip memorable for the children. Last, but not least, earlier in the morning the children took a ride on the small ‘train’. One of the children forgot his towel on the train. About an hour later the operator/attendant of the train came looking for my boy, holding a towel, that my boy forgot whilst riding on the train. Wow...! \nI sincerely want to thank you, because a place can be well-maintained, and run like an oiled machine, but if the staff is surly, a family day-out can be ruined. Thank you!!",

During our operational review meeting on 26 September, it was decided that the number of birthday parties will be limited on days coinciding with special events like Family Fun Days. This is to ensure that you get the service you deserve. We are very sorry if we disappointed you.",

  "text": "The lion park offers a large swimming pool, slides and an amusement park. It also offers conference rooms. We were here with the children as we wanted to discover all the things to see and to around Gaborone. We noticed a lot of litter and debris in the amusement park lying around. Parts of the pavement were washed away and caved in. The roller coaster didn't look like it was maintained in the last decade (we later learned that one of our friends kids got stuck in there, hanging upside down...) The pool and slides were the only place where our children had some fun, but the swimming pool was not very clean. We also went to see the lions, but for me I don't like seeing lions in caged surroundings. Ticket price is reasonable compared to European standards, but high to local standards. I would not recommend this place, there are many other things to do and see in Botswana. This place is more for the residents to go to as a place to celebrate birthday parties or a family picnic.",

I would have appreciated the opportunity to respond to some of your allegations before you used a public platform to publicise your review. However, let me try my best to respond to your review.\n\n1.\tYour friend is not telling the truth, if she states that her “kids got stuck in there, hanging upside down…”. The roller coaster has NEVER, during its time with us, been stuck or stopped on any section of the free running track of the ride. This includes the vertical loop, which is the only section on the ride where the rider is inverted.\n2.\tThe roller coaster was installed 6 years ago and it is maintained by an experienced maintenance team. The only problem we have is the paint, which was used to repaint the steel track during installation of the roller coaster. The new paint started to lift in sections about 1 year ago. This lifting is caused by a compatibility problem with the paint previously applied to the ride and aggravated by the harsh sunlight experienced in Botswana.\n3.\tWe have cared for our lions since they had been rescued as cubs. Their enclosure is 11,700m2, which is most certainly not a cage. We’ve acted responsibly by having the 3 male lions undergo vasectomies. Resulting in them being able to perform the act needed to procreate without inseminating the 2 lionesses.\n4.\tI cannot agree with your statement, that the swimming pool water was not clean. The wave pool is our pride and the joy of our visitors. We are very meticulous about the quality of the water in our pools.\n5.\tThe washed away paving; was an old storm water drain, which were damaged during a massive rain storm. The area is well demarcated, preventing customers access to the area. To date, designs for a new drain had been completed with an ongoing tender process for the construction of a new storm water drain.\n",

Wildlife will depend on when you go, but in November we saw lots of wildebeest, jackals, and different birds. The horizon was pink with flamingoes and pelicans in the pan. I’m guessing some people might drive in and wonder what all the fuss is about as it’s a flat plain with some wildebeest , but if you take the time and give this community run place a chance it is really very special :)",

We've seen a few pelicans and flamingos here before, but this year the pan had hundreds of pelicans and other birds. They were fishing in large \"rafts\" close to shore. We also had good sightings of Kori Bustard and antelopes.\n\nDon't use the viewing platform, it is no longer safe. But it's not necessary.\n\nFriendly staff at the reception. We used the toilets then drove out to the pans. The roads were dry and OK (Fortuner 4x4, but a normal car is OK when it is dry).\n\nWe had excellent lunch at nearby Nata Lodge, also great place to stay.",

  "text": "The sign at the gate clearly says no picnics. I certainly have no issues with a picnic, but we were met at the viewing tower with about 50 people falling around with loud music and bottles of alcohol everywhere. It seems to be a good weekend spot for some of the people living in Nata for an excursion. I would not come over a weekend. It was unpleasant and considering the pans were full of water, it was the only place to get close to the pans. So we basically drove in, saw some Wildebeest on the way in, no birds and a hoard of drunk people hogging the only viewing site.\nAt the gate the lady did say that there were many Motswana inside, but we should try and find a spot for ourselves. I didn’t know what she meant by the comment until we reached the pans. My family were very disappointed in the experience and from arriving at the gate and leaving it was less than an hour. A waste of time and money on this occasion.",

  "text": "Took an afternoon self drive with my parents and some friends. Made it to the watch tower very easily and enjoyed a lunch there whilst overlooking the salt pans. They are currently full of water so you cannot go onto them. Saw some pelicans but flamingos are not yet there due to water being too high. Also saw some wildebeest. Lovely day trip and well worth the visit if you’ve never been before. If you don’t want to drive there yourself or do not feel your vehicle will make the dirt road you can book a trip with Nata Lodge and you can go in one of their vehicles",

It was impossible to pass with a normal car and our Landcruiser could just make it. We could easily be stuck in one of the many deep water pools in the road. It was impressive to see the salt lake, but we only saw a few birds and no flamingos or pelicans. The ranger informed us in advance that there were few birds and the road was next to impassable. ",

Whilst the animals are limited to gnus, zebras, springbuck, and ostriches, seeing an ostrich nest up close is a bonus. Also the greater flamingo and pelicans were in attendance at the pans apart from other birds like the corry buzzard. Of course the pans and their history and the glorious sunsets round of a well worthwhile day.",

  "text": "I drove down from Elephant Sands to the Nata bird sanctuary in the hope of seeing a variety of birds, The entrance fee is a steep BWP135 (I am a foreigner and was riving aa SA registered rental) for what was no more than a possible 7.5kms worth of drivable roads. \n\nThe Sua pan was full of water and I did see a few pelicans and some other birds but zero sight of the famous flamingos.  \n\nIf you happen to be passing via Nata then you could stop here for a couple of hours but bear in mind the steep entrance price - you pay per car and per passenger as well.\n\nI would not make a special trip just to see Nata Bird Sanctuary,\n\nA word of caution, do not underestimate the road - a slight spot of brown colouration should read danger. I saw some Swiss tourists drive through the not so dry road and they were bogged in very quickly,\n\nAs a side note, they do have their own camping site which I drove around and it was truly in a sad state with not a single site occupied,",

A great place to be, to get an impression of the pans, the lake there and the wideness with lots of animals like the gnu, the austrich, the steinbock besides the birds. It was really worth to do it!!!!\nWe went there in the early morning round 8 o clock and had a good time there, from 10 o clock its getting really hot the last october days.... if you like to get out of the car, it is necessary to wear long trousers and good shoes. The grass is quite stingy.",

We saw huge flocks of Flamingoes & many Pelicans amongst many other birds - a wonderful place to pass the day!",

  "text": "We took an afternoon game drive, organised by Nata lodge. I think our guide was taking his exams, as he seemed a bit nervous and we were accompanied by a second guide, who seems more experienced and was quietly in the background, listening to everything our guide said. Due to this exam, our guide to-be was keen on sharing all the information he had in him and that was a fun and interesting experience. He told u things that weren't necessarily pertinent to the actual sighting, so we learned a lot. I am sure once this guide will had a bit of a routine, he will be great.\nBeing in the sanctuary gives you a good insight of what the pans look like, and which animals and plants grow there. The flamingo's hadn't arrived yet, due to the high amount of water that was still in the pans, but we did see a few pelicans. The sunset was just spectacular and the (salt)lake at the platform location had a wonderful and strange image of disappearing in the sky on the horizon. We also saw some bigger game (zebra, springbok, wildebeest) and nocturnal animal on our way back to the exit. I would recommend a guide as I didn't see any signing in the park.",

  "text": "I have been staying here for a number of years and whilst Avani have done a number of things to improve the hotel there is still some way to go.\nMahogany's needs a complete revamp. Quality of food isn't great, waiting time to receive food is very slow. You need to have specials.\nRooms need to be available at check in time.\nVery young staff, many trainees who don;t seem to know what they are doing.\nDespite me being signed up to the loyalty  program  I have never received anything! And have sent many e-mails.",

  "text": "The stay at Gaborone Sun now known as Avani Gaborone Resort & Sun was comfortable from the prespective of the room. Being a vegetarian I struggled with food as variety was lacking and seemed like food was repeated. In toom.dining was not the best.\n\nBreakfast seemed lacking as well.\nThe Pantry which is a shop at the hotel had decent smacks.  For meat eaters there is sufficient variety.\n\nHas a gym facility and pool. There is also a casino for those avid gamblers.",

  "text": "We stayed in Avani (previously Gaborone Sun, but everybody still calls it that, even taxi drivers) in February 2016 with our children while we were looking for housing in Gaborone. It's a nice hotel and they have done a lot of revamping. The rooms are spacious, the beds are very comfortable and they have connecting rooms (nice when travelling with kids under 18). The hotel swimming pool is clean and the pool area is a nice place to eat and have a drink. Since February 2016 it even has improved a lot in August 2017 and I visited an art gallery night here. Next door you will find the Gaborone Golf Course for those who love to bring their golf clubs.  The rooms are quite expensive, there are more affordable places in town if you are on a budget. Just check the booking sites for a favourable price. The hotel organises quite a few events and the poolbar is the place to go on a Friday night.",

  "text": "But for there being no lift I would have given it 5 stars. This is now in a different group and you can see that it is no longer like a standard Sun hotel. It is now the Avani. You get the impression from the staff and the write ups that they are in the business to help you and make your stay is enjoyable. It starts with the doormen who are helpful who do not look as tho they are looking just for the tip. We had trouble checking in  but this was sorted out by Gotlme Muloije. As we were tired after a very long day we decide to eat in the Montgomery which was excellent. I wrote this up in the restaurant section of The TripAdvisor. The rooms are large and have everything where it should be. The electric sockets have South African and European types. No adapters needed. Very attractive pool and also the  lounges. They have a happy hour from 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm  with 25% discount which saves some money.. Looking at the number of hotels in this group and the cities where they are located they are catering for regular business people. If I were back in business I would certainly see whether this group had a hotel in the city I was going to. Well worth staying at.",

  "text": "I've always felt that Gaborone Sun, now Avani Hotel, was one of the better hotels in Gaborone. The rooms aren't bad but I feel a lot of the rooms have parts that are outdated and in serious need of an update. I was given a room in the block at the back; the room was amazing (bed, couches, amenities) but the bathroom was a bit dilapidated. I then requested a room closer to the reception; in this case, the room was also great and so was the bathroom but the airconditioner/heater wasn't working. All in all the hotel itself isn't too bad but it would be great if all the rooms in the same price range were uniform.",

I am told this place is not only a place of worship for Indian people but, is more on the spiritual platform that talks about bhakti yoga practises. \n\nI highly rate this place as a place of Zen. Also the food is absolutely delicious. Expect to get a free meal every Sunday afternoon at 1300hrs or Sunday evening at 1900hrs, depending on the season. \n\nThe best thing I experienced here was the Diwali Food festival. The food was great, the people were great and the atmosphere was vibrant.",

  "text": "Fomos visitar o templo ISKCON (Sociedade Internacional para a Consciência do Hinduísmo/Centro Hare Krishna de Bhakti Yoga) O templo ISKCON Botswana situa-se em Gaborone. É um bonito templo que atraiu muitas pessoas de todas as partes do país para ver sua magnífica obra de arte que pode ser vista no exterior e especialmente no interior do templo, onde não se pode fotografar. O templo é a casa de Sri Sri Kirishna e Balarama. Lugar agradável, bem cuidado, limpo e com pessoas muito simpáticas para atende-lo. Vale a pena fazer essa visita.",

We had an excellent guide and did the Rhino Trail, which has 16 viewpoints. This trail also takes one up to the top and along a ridge for views, if you wish. There are fantastic depictions of antelope, rhinos, zebra, tortoises, and even a whale and penguin in these paintings, some of over 4500 in the area. The museum has excellent explanations of the life and history of the people who did the art – and the spiritual significance of the mountains as well.",

Not too strenuous and good rock art viewings. Lion, summit and cliff trail were P175.  Entrance was P50 pp which goes to the community and your walk fee goes to the guide (although 1 guide tried to tell us the walk fee went to the community - we got a different guide and he explained that's not how it works so I think the first guide was trying to make extra tips). There is a campsite there but the ablutions were awful so I wouldn't stay there. ",

  "text": "the site, the paintings, the museum, very good to excellent, BUT to get there is a mission. 2/3 of the access road is badly corrugated shaking the vehicle to pieces and forcing one to travel at very slow speed. The 30 odd km take a good hour, so 2 hours are gone for the return trip. The nearest accommodation is far away hence the time available for actually enjoying and studying the site is vastly reduced. The upkeep of the ablutions and overall area is poor, and it being a UNESCO heritage site it's disgraceful and, overall our impression was a big disappointment.",

  "text": "The hills, overlooking the Kalahari are the home of the San people for millenia.  There are wall paintings, still vivid after 2,000 years, of the wildlife they encountered.  In addiiton, there are later paintings, pehraps 1,500 years old, displaying the domestic animals - perhaps a sign of moving from hunting-gathering to agriculture?  The guides are well-informed Bushmen, as was our guide from our Lodge.  They demonstrated their langauge and different dialects, with various \"clicks\" as we walked through the hills.  There are several paths, ranging from an easy 2-hour journey to a more strenous 4 hour hike.  Because we are nearing 80, the guides deiced on the asy path for us.  We still saw an abundance of paintings and it really was easy.",

  "text": "What a wonderful trip we had to Tsodilo Hills!\nFirst of all we were abit worried about the road condition as we did not have 4x4 and the sand they said could turn tricky after the evening rain and thunderstorm.  Luckily, we had no problem whatsoever.\nWe arrived at the gate at 7.30am so as to avoid the heat of midday. Again we were lucky. It was slightly overcast throughout our walk.  If you want to go on one of the longer trails, I think, it is important to arrive early because it can get extremely hot.\nAll 4 of us are senior citizens and I suffer from vertigo so we did not want a strenuous uphill hike, just an hour's walk to see a few of the San paintings and to feel the energy of these Holy hills. \nOur guide LOPANG was excellent. Such a sweet boy, he understood exactly what we wanted and gave us a wonderful 1hr hike at the bottom of Female Hill - the so called Rhino Trail.\nMore than anything, I was amazed by the beautiful colours of the rocks, the pastel pinks and oranges and creams, so breathtakingly beautiful.\nDefinitely worth a visit and definitely worth having Lopang with you.\n",

  "text": "Tsodilo used to be one of my favorite spots as a child. You had free reign of the entire place. As kids we would climb up and crawl through everything.\nThese days however it's a different story. Camping used to be free, which was great because you had to bring all your own gear. Now however they have started charging a lot of money to camp in a place that offers very little. The ablutions have not worked properly in 20 years and still don't even though they now charge to stay there. Where we used to be able to hike around Tsodilo by ourselves we now have to pay guides to take us to places that we know as well as they do.\nUnfortunately I have now stopped going to Tsodilo as it's just not worth it anymore.

  "text": "In the lonely planet tjhey tellyou that this place is very special and a must see. And that this holy place for the San can be visited for free. The last is no longer true. We arrived over a quite well kept gravel road and found a gate now with a very unfriendly lady who told us that we had to pass the gate to the campsite, the gate to the hills, also there ,had been closed. I do not know why. We had to pay a quite high entrance fee , just to go to the empty campsite that we did not need and had to search for the road to the trails. We passed some very bad paths and reached a new build center wher a very enthusiastic man told us that the government had decided that the local village people had to earn money from the tourists that came to visit their wholy place. Do you pay for visiting the St Peter or the golden mosk or other wholy places? Yes i payed for visiting a buddhist temple in Bali and felt robbed too. We also had to take a guide because , as the man told us, the tourists often damaged the place when they walked there alone. We got a young man as a guide who hardly spoke English and seemed very annoyed to do this task. We are not very young anymore and he told us we had to go the other way around as the most easy trail, the rhino trail, still was very difficult. We indeed saw very interesting drawings , not carfed in the rocks as in Namibia at twyfelfontein, but really painted on it with some mixture of blood roots etc. The paintings are red. Also the surroundings were very beautiful but the path was indeed very difficult to walk, or better climb. One of us hardly could come down the very steep and rocky hills.The guide did not offer him any help and walked on in front of us without even looking. I would not recommend this walk . And the eager of local villagers to earn is bigger than their eager to welcome you and help you. I guess that the spirits of their ancestors are not happy with the behavior of this new generation. Overall I think that visiting the place is not worth the long journey and the money.",

  "text": "We booked 7 days camping at Tsodilo Hills Community campsite as all other sites were fully booked. The plan was to use this as a base camp from where we can explore the upper Western part of Botswana. They charged a ridiculous price of 140 Pula per person per day, which is around R 190 South African Rand.\nOn arrival, there was no one at the main gate. I opened the gate myself and only then did people come running out the bush trying to sell us curios and offered to wash my Landy. We were told to wait for the person who will assist us with our booking. After approx. 20 minutes the person arrived. I gave her our proof of payment, and as we were already 2 days late , she wanted to refund the 2 days camping that we lost. I told her not to worry about that, as it was my fault that we were late. When we got to our campsite it was strewn with litter, the rubbish bin was overflowing with rubbish, used toilet paper all over. The ablutions were even worse. Rubbish all over the place and it looked like an Elephant had used the shower just before we came. Mud everywhere. I then noticed that non of the toilets had seats. We decided to take a drive around the UNESCO World Heritage Site while deciding what to do about the camping. While driving around the hills we decided not to stay in the campsite. On exiting the community site, i told the lady that we were very unhappy with this place and we decided not to stay there. She got extremely upset about our leaving, and she promised that they would go clean everything during the coarse of the day. I flatly refused and then she got really upset. She said that we now owe her another 200 Pula as we entered the Tsodilo Hills National Park. This after we already paid 1400 Pula?? I refused to pay and also informed her that i want all my money back, which she now refused. So we just left and found a spot at Shakawe, Drotskys Cabins and Camping right next to the swamps. We did lay a complaint at the Tourism Board in Maun, so we will see what happens and i hope we will get a full refund.",

The guide touched the paintings. Some rock shelters where we were told stone age people would have sheltered with out any evidence or commentry about the research. we walked to the ridge where one could see the kalahari and the delta.\nThen shown some pottery fragments set in a circle with some bone. told these were evidence of trading.\nA water buffulo tread in rock from when the rock was soft and animals could talk. etc.\n\nwhen we slipped and slid to the gates in the morning of the 26th the woman who was supposed to be there at 7 was no where to be seen didn't appear untill at least 8.30 by that time there was one vechicle waiting to leave and three waiting to get in\nthe place is beautiful the art astounding the site badly managed by the local community the guides not well trained the walks a mix of beauty and disney.\nid go again tomorrow( in a 4x4 if it was wet) do my own research (books avaliable at craft shop opposite Maun airport terminal) and ignore the guide.",

  "text": "This world heritage site has been handed over to the local community who rakes in over 1 million Dollars a year and treats their tourists in the most disgraceful manner.  While the  site itself is awesome, the campsite (only accommodation for miles) has been utterly abandoned by this greedy community.  The ablutions have never been cleaned, but how would one know as they are too cheap to even replace the light bulb.  Many hundreds of people pass through this camp site including large school groups but not one person has ever felt that making tourists, who have flown in from around the world to enjoy the experience, feel more comfortable.  Regrettably I brought my torch, as the ablutions are pitch dark even in daylight, and was disgusted at the lack of respect for those that foot the 1 million dollar bill annually.  Shame on the community.  We were told that we must take a tour guide to visit the hills and may not go on our own.  The guides told us that they come on duty at 07h30 in the morning.  At 08h30 we were ready for our tour but everyone had disappeared - probably to have their breakfast, so we went on our own.  It took about 2,5 hours to do the round trip but it was pretty tough going.  I suggest that you take 2 days to see Tsodilo Hills.  Stay at the excellent Drotsky's camping and accommodation and drive during the day to see the Hills.  It is a reasonable distance so it makes sense to do it over 2 days and enjoy Drotsky's river side haven. Tsodilo Hills camp site is a disgusting site and should be boycotted till the community gets some respect for their tourists.  However please bring some food for the starving 3 legged dog as the over fed locals have not even scraps for \"Ole 3 Leg\".",

  "text": "After 33km of travelling on a 'dirt' road, we saw the Tsodilo Hills signs pointing to the right to a short dead end.  There was a gate clearly stating, Tsodilo Hills, but the gate was chained and padlocked with no one in sight.  It was 12.45 on a Saturday, and seeing no other signs or notices to the contrary, we just went back the 33km to the main road.  Apparently, this is the óld' gate.  The new gate is further on -and round the corner to the right, but when asking for directions, before we set off, no one mentioned the old and new gate!  Bit of a waste of time, fuel and was not very pleasant driving on the poor road surface.  Disappointed and felt a bit thick, that we hadn't thought to explore a bit further on.  I think that the road's condition had put us in a fairly out of sorts mood!  To add to our mood was the fact that although we had found diesel at a garage in Shakawe, the amount it took to fill the car seemed excessive compared to the car's fuel usage, by 11 litres!  Seriously! Of course they would only take cash.  The rest of our holiday was so fantastic.  This is just a small moan, but I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake we did.   ",

  "text": "As an UNESCO heritage site it has some beautiful rock art. The guide date good but every walk is asleep rate fee of 120 pula. You can only do one walk per fee. The road about the visitor centre is truly awful. No one is looking after the place. I even collected plastic walking about and the guide looked amazed that someone would collect rubbish. Camp site has water at rate times and the cost of 400 pula to camp as a family is ridiculous. The boy at the front gate had a terrible attitude. No omegas any interest at in the site and it's disappointing that there are no longer san people near the mountain as they were all removed by the government in 2008 toa local village. The guides are all Bantu and the rock art is not from  their  people. I would love to have had a San guide to make it a more authentic experience. Have a look but do not plan a stay over. Also, donkeys are all over the place which is also not good. UNESCO need to review the current strategy of this wonderful site.",

Donkey and cow dung everywhere, no hot shower although solar installation, and at times no water. We did not even feel like venturing the bad road back to the visitors centre to see the rock paintings. So sad to see the disinterest and lack of pride by the local people in what could be a fantastic destination. The price for camping and entrance are exorbitant for what one gets.  Not a place that I would recommend to visit.",

  "text": "The campsite was moved from the foot of the mountain to about 3 km away where you can't really see the mountain. You're in the middle of the bush, so the landscape is not very interesting. There are showers and toilets close to the campsite. I spent one night there with 3 friends. When we got from the Cliff walk at night we tried to take a shower but surprise : NO HOT WATER!!! The next morning we tried to take a shower again and, surprise number two : NO WATER AT ALL!!! No even to wash out our faces! When we left the place we talked to the lady at the entrance ( which is probably the only person you can talk to if there is a problem ) and she really didn't seem to mind. There is a HUGE discrepancy between the abusively high campsite prices and the quality of service provided by the people in charge.",

  "text": "The rock art at this site is unique and quite amazing, I advise getting up early to try and see as much as possible. The caves are beautiful too and a great place to reflect on the history of the ancient site. It's best to catch the guides on their first walk of the day, they'll be more likely to take you to the less accessible places (they spend the whole day walking). I went late on in the day and the guide definitely didn't take me the whole way around but I was too tired to care after a long day. There are different routes you can take, most of them costing 120 Pula, the most expensive one being 175 Pula. There is a campsite right next to the entrance which is 130 Pula pppn for camping and 50 Pula entrance fee to the hills. The entrance gate is about 5km from the hills and it's best to just follow the side fence until you can see a track taking you towards the smaller hills. Make sure to charge all your equipment before you go and take a couple of spare toilet rolls. I travelled there without a vehicle. It's around 30km from the main tarmac road and so quite far to walk. I was lucky and waited at the road for ten minutes before a truck came and so I got on the back of that which took me to the main gate for 10 Pula. I wasn't as lucky on the way back though and waited for four hours, but I got there eventually. If you're travelling alone, with no vehicle or a time limit, travelling here is definitely something you can do, despite what people may tell you. Well worth a visit if you're in the Caprivi Strip or in Maun.",

What was even more astounding was the panel with the whales and the penguin - that the people who painted them had been more than a 1000km west of the site at some stage is incredible.. You preferably need a robust vehicle to get there, but if you've got several hours to kill and you are capable of at least a 2.5 hour walk on the shortest trail (the rhino), then pay a visit.",

  "text": "I recommend that a 4x4 vehicle is used as the road condition varies depending on the weather. Ensure that you confirm the directions both to the site and when leaving as the signage is poor and if in doubt rather back track than getting stuck in deep sand or mud.\n\nThere is an entrance fee at the gate and an additional fee for the tour guide. Our guide was informative but the rest of the visitor centre, museum and facilities needs general maintenance and good management to be implemented to ensure longevity of the facility.\n\nOur groups age ranged from 14yrs - 64yrs (with a hip replacement and a non-gym member). We all did the harder trail up to the top of the hill. But what goes up must come down and the decline had to be well negotiated as we had been caught in the rain (rocks where a little slippery). We all made it down safely, but ensure that you are medically fit and up for the challenge. There is an easier bottom route as an alternative. If its going to be a hot day ensure that you get an early start to the tour before the heat of the day.\n\nRemember your sun block, hat, camera (small backpack/water tight camera bag in the event it rains and to ensure the safety of your valuables i.e. mobile phone) while clambering down the rocks as in some places you need to assist yourself by holding onto a rock/branch/tree. Take along a (small) water bottle.\n\nTake a picnic basket and camping chairs with you and leave it in your locked vehicle for a nice snack after the guided tour.\n\nThe toilet facilities did not have toilet paper, soap or lights the day we visited (take your head lamp with you/torch) and due to the power failure we could not look around the museum.\n\nThe hills are a comparatively small group of isolated quartzite inselbergs (from German: Insel, “island,” and Berg, “mountain”) and can be seen from up to 100km's away and are situated in the heart of the Great Central Plateau of Southern Africa in Botswana, which is a very flat country in the African context. \nLocated on the edge of the Kalahari Desert, in the extreme north-west of Botswana, close to the Namibian border. The outcrop also known as the \"male, female and child\" is 40 kilometres west of the main road - near Shakawe.\n\nThe occurrence of inselbergs implies immense variations in the rates of degradational activity on the land surface. These structures are one of several varieties of landform called paleoforms that can survive with little modification for tens of millions of years. \n\nTsodilo hills has over 4,500 rock art paintings depicting a variety of subjects, including wild animals, people, cattle (introduced in the 6th century AD), riders on horses (1850's) and other domestic animals and various geometric symbols and designs (1000 years old), with the latest paintings dating to the 19th century.",

  "text": "Tsodilo Hills is, beside the newly added Okavango Delta the only UNESCO site in Botswana. It is situated in the far northeast and very remote. It took us a three hour drive to get there. It is poorly indicated (we had to ask a few local children the way for the last 6 kilometer, a horrible experience over the very bad roads. Don't turn around, eventually you will get there. After this trip we got to the visitor centre with a small museum. Hiring a guide is compulsory. Maybe we had the wrong guide (uninterested in us) but he showed us all the carvings and paintings. Nevertheless interesting to witness the remnants of early human settlement in this area.",

The access road from the main road to the museum is shamefully inadequate. Where is the ministry of tourism in all this?",

Leopards on trees not far than 3 meters from you, Hyppos on the road especially at sunset are totally but rare, Giraffes, hyenas and buffalos complete the collection. Every camp you will chose ( mine was Khwai River Lodge ) will assist with the best rangers of the world. They will introduce you in a wild world tiptoeing, and will explain the delicate balances that rule something we still have in our DNA after 50.000 years.",

On the northerly side of the bridge is Khwai Village, which has a community camp.  The community camps do not differentiate in price between SADC citizens and foreigners, unlike the Botswana Game Reserve that contracts out all accommodation the reserves  which is  expensive for foreigners compared to SADC citizens.  It would pay foreigners to rather stay at community camps and go into the Reserves daily. There is not differentiation in the entry cost for SADC and foreigners to Botswana reserves.",

A huge thankyou to our guide , Richard , who was superb . He gave us so many exceptional wildlife sightings of elephants, lions , leopards as well as a fascinating pack of wild dogs . We also enjoyed the wonderful singing and dancing performed at the bomb evenings. \nFantastic experience- we would love to return before too long . ",

The geography of the place is stunning with the beautiful Khwai river serving as a backdrop to all possible kind of birds and animals - hippos (hundreds), impalas, lechwes, kudus, hyenas, giraffes, elephants and also lions.\nLots of birds too. One does need a guide to enjoy this place though - we did see some vehicles who were attempting self drives. Experienced guides with their excellent knowledge of the topography, climate, sharp eyesight and the senses can give one much more in a safari.\nKhwai shall not disappoint.",

  "text": "During our safari, we camped in Moremi, Khwai, Savuti and Chobe.  Khwai was by far my favorite in terms of the nice river that ran through it and the views of the wildlife.  The river means that you get to see the \"prey\" animals hang out by the water on a regular basis...including lots of elephants and hippos.  But it also means lots of \"predator\" animal sightings as well.  We got to watch two lions \"arguing\" over territory and also saw a leopard mother (Mma Tsebe) and her two year old son hanging out and gnawing on a red lechwe that they had killed (we saw them over two separate days and felt very blessed).  If you are planning a safari (either on your own or with a tour group, be sure that it includes a stop in Khwai!!",

  "text": "We visited th Khwai Region while driving from Chobe NP Mababe (South) Gate to the Moremi North Gate. Despite the new gravel road, we tried to get as much Khwai river front experience as possible. This was quite difficult because of high water and the main track flooded in many places. But it was very worthwhile, as we spotted many animals, mainly herds of zebras, elephants, girafes an many hippos. Highlight for me was the opportunity to watch elephants bathing and diving in the river and playing with each other in the water.\nThe many tracks are difficult to navigate and in parts quite deep sandy. But it is very rewarding to take the effort and to stay as close as possible to the river. Avoid water crossings, especially if you do not see how deep they are and what the ground Looks like. If you have bad luck, you can easily dump your car in the river ...",

  "text": "What an experience! You will need a 4x4 vehicle here, and to be travelling together with at least one other vehicle. Also,you will need recovery gear like a long reach jack, tow rope, axe, etc. Definitely a first aid kit, anti malaria tablets and sufficient provisions. Always stop to assist others and hope for the same. This is the real raw African bush and you can expect to be in the same space as lions,buffalo, elephants and other dangerous animals, insects,snakes and things. But you will feel ALIVE like never before and the only stress will be healthy survival awareness. One of the precious places in my heart, also because of thecproximity of the San bushmen. Do this!! Even ifvit is the only thing you do.",

The experience of feeling one with nature, not seeing or hearing anything besides lions, hippos and hyeans  was life changing. Make no mistake we were vigilant but never had any hair raising experiences.\n\nThere are no facilities here so make sure you have enough water, food and fuel. \n\nSitting and watching elephants and hippos playing no more than 40 m from our camp in the water was incredible. Make sure you get to experience this.\n\nWe also saw more animals in one afternoon on a game drive in Khai than we saw in. Moremi. Next time I might stay at Third. Bridge for one night and the rest in Khwai. It was that good!",

  "text": "Khwai village is located just outside Moremi National Park, home to Okavango Delta. If you want true nature connection camp at Mogotho campsites. No toilets or running water you take what you bring! This place is like having a home zoo; close by there is a hippo pool, and more big 5 crew. For those into birds you will not be disappointed too. Good balance for everyone.",

Another fantastic location in the Delta with terrific staff.  Food was good but not as much choice as at Eagle Island and Savute although all part of Orient Express.  Fantastic game drives with plenty to see.  Cooling off in the pool would have been great but it was in the full glare of the sun with no shade, which was a pity.  Shortly to close for a month for renovation so maybe the aircon will be upgraded.",

  "text": "Muy pocos sitios en el mundo te dan la oportunidad de acampar en medio de la naturaleza de la forma que se puede hacer en Kwai. Aquí no hay vallas, no hay guardas, no hay nada entre tú y la naturaleza. \nNosotros acampamos en Kwai River Bridge, en el único camping (excluyendo los lodges de lujo, claro) que hay. Y son como 10 sitios, con 1 poco de cemento para hacer hoguera, con un grifo para el agua y unos baños comunes que tienen agua caliente por disponer de placas solares. Por supuesto, no hay luz. El acceso es complicado, hay muchos bancos de arena y a veces se inundan, por lo que un buen 4x4 es no recomendable, pero obligatorio.\nLa emoción de irse a dormir pronto, al poco de caer la luz y antes de que se apague tu hoguera, de ver y oir a los animales, a veces a uno o dos metros de tí, no tiene precio.\nEso sí, no vayan con niños.",

Hier kann man alles sehen, was zu sehen ist.Die Wege sind zwar nur in richtigen 4x4 Fahrzeugen zu bewältigen aber man kommt hautnah an die Tiere heran, denn es gibt immer einen Pfad auf dem man noch näher herankommt. Aufpassen auf Verbotsschilder, hier sollte man auf keinen Fall weiterfahren, denn die privaten, extrem teuren Gamelodges verstehen da keinen Spass.",

Except for the Big 5, there are many African animals roaming free in natural surroundings but all within the city limits. because there are no predators, picnicking is allowed and you can bike or walk the trails. Take time to look and you will see and hear many wonderful birds. This is a great and cheap way to spend a day in Gaborone.",

However, the entry fee is so very low (approx. 10 pula equivalent to about US $ 1.-), you may not expect any proper maintenance. At the more remote spots, of the reserve, human garbage is accumulating, and it really is a pity, to see nothing more is done to improve on the nice collection of endemic species (Zebra, Eland, Ostrich, Warthog, various bird species etc. My advise: Clean up your act, increase price dramatically, so you can have some proper improvements done, invite your local pupils to learn about the beauty of Africa!",

But once you do, you will get to enjoy the visit! Tucked away at the Gaborone Military Force since Botswana has yet to know how to handle such, the military takes care of this animals... It was simply amazing getting to see the white lions, the huge hyenas, the biggest python have ever seen and HELD! Yes I did hold a live PYTHON! One of the greatest highlight on my trip definitely!",

  "text": "The Gaborone Game reserve is just around the corner in town. The entrance fee is 10BWP per person and 10 BWP for a car. You can also picnic or braai in the game reserve (at a little extra fee). Residents go here on Saturday morning to have breakfast or in the late afternoon to braai. You will encounter zebras, impalas, warthog, ostrich, kudu, monkeys and rock hyrax. It is not possible to go on foot, you will have to drive in this reserve. We went on late afternoon and drove past a group of trees and all of a sudden all of these hyrax were dropping out of the tree (they were probably eating or sunbathing). I have been to this game reserve 4 times now and it is still nice to drive around, never knowing when you will see the animals. Of course the game reserve is nothing compared to Chobe, but a nice place to go if you just need to get out of your hotel room or want to get out with the family. On weekdays entrance is easy, in the weekend you have to book in advance (as they only allow so many people in the game reserve).",

  "text": "I was just a few days in Gaborone and wanted to go on a short game drive. I decided to just rent a taxi for a few hours ($10 per hour all inclusive should be fair), and got driven around in this very small, yet cute game reserve. \nEntry will be 10 Pula per person plus another 10 per vehicle. The game presented here is diverse but not dangerous. I guess that makes it a great place to visit with children: you can just exit your vehicle to go for a closer inspection of an area without running the risk of ending up as a lion's supper, as there are no lions. \nThere's a picnic place or two in the center of the park and this is probably where you'll find most of the monkeys. \nI've been told that the park is usually packed with people during the weekends and holidays, so it may be worth visiting on a regular week day. When I was there, it was just me and my taxi driver, so we had the park all for our selves. Which was great. \nI recommend to spend about 2 hours here, as that's sufficient to see everything worth seeing here. \nAnyway, I really liked my drive here. If they could add a few more types of game, I'd give it a 5 star rating. For now, it's a good 4 stars.",

  "text": "So close to the city centre, easy to find and access in any vehicle, so this is a good way to spend an hour or two. It's just P10 per person and per vehicle no matter what the nationality which makes a change from other parks. Nice viewing of Gemsbok and I had less than an hour to get around. Ostrich came close to the car. Just be careful on some of the deeply rutted tracks if you're not in a 4x4. Very dry at the moment but feed is put out and the animals look healthy with lots of baby impala to see quite close up if you approach slowly. ",

  "text": "Situated on the outskirts of Gaborone (capital of Botswana) near Game City Mall, this is an ideal morning getaway especially on weekends. A short drive straight from Game City (instead of entering the mall parking) and the road turns left towards a gravel path and then again on left hand side, a makeshift parking exists, which serves as entrance to the Kgale Hill (pronounced Kaaley Hill) Public Park. Two adjacent paths can be seen, though both lead to the same first plateau with about 15-20 minutes of not-so-difficult rocky hike on granite rocks. From this plateau, a brief steep hike gets climbers to the top of first smaller hill, with a scenic view point on right hand side and a nice cool breeze. From this point, a 10 minute downhill and then a steep 15-20 minute uphill hike opens up to the top of the Kgale Hill from where Gaborone Dam and Mokolodi Nature Reserve offer beautiful views, as also the A1 highway going to Lobatse. Many people can be seen imbibing the views, doing light exercises and stretching at the hilltop. Undoubtedly, it is a popular destination for many locals and visitors, especially on weekend mornings when weather is not too hot. Children 10 years and above can complete the trail (both the hills) with enthusiasm. November and December appear to be ideal months, because of verdancy after the rains in the region. Walking path is easily noticeable and no particular tour guide is needed in this 2.5 hour (approx) adventure.",

There are few routes up the hill. Take the one to left for a bit more of a rocky vertical climb or the one to the right for a flatter climb. \n\nBoth climbs end up the top of the hill next to the phone towers and present a beautiful view over the Gabs dam and city. \n\nIt’s definitely worth the exercise and most certainly worth the view!",

  "text": "Kgale hill is a must to climb, if you have the stamina. It's not a real easy climb, but if you are in a normal/good condition you can climb the hill. Like the hill in Oodi, this is a place where a lot of people go for a picnic when the moon is full. We did the climb after work and had a nice view on the city. Leave your jewellery and other belongings at home. Beware of baboons (we didn't encounter any, but baboons are everywhere in Africa). I wouldn't recommend this for families with very small children.",

However if you go in a group, 3 or more, and if you go during the busier and cooler early mornings on the weekends you will be safest. \n\nFollow the white arrows for a good walk and small scrabble at parts (managed by almost all but those with bad hips).... otherwise there is a concrete drive up to the top just to the right of the path - BUT ask for directions as its starting location isn't easy to find otherwise.",

  "text": "There are different options to the walk - the difficult option where you will be going on all fours over very steep terrain or the alternative is a concrete road to the top. The views are very rewarding and well worth the effort. It is possible to fit it in after work and takes approximately one hour to the top if you keep a consistent pace. A leisurely  walk will take much longer and will provide for an opportunity to do birding and an opportunity sit on the rocky outcrops to enjoy the views which are fantastic! The route can be busy after work with runners so go during office hours if you prefer the peace and tranquillity of the bush.",

  "text": "Well worth the effort given the peace, serenity and superb view from the top.\nDon't expect however a simple guided journey up there. A taxi driver will drop you off on the main road at a set of concrete stairs over the fence marked by a coloured drum. From there you'll see a path straight ahead towards the base of the hill and another that seems it's a perimeter track headed hard left and right.\nIf you take the one straight ahead, after a few hundred meters it becomes almost indistinguishable amidst increasingly solid bushland as you then need to make out a route between large rockfaces. It's not hard as long as you plan out a sensible route to the top.",

  "text": "We reserved a campsite in the Mokolodi Nature Reserve close to Gabarone on our way to South Africa after a 3-week 4x4 Botswana trip. The Nature Reserve was easy to find and at the reception we were told to enter the park through a second gate and follow the signs to Chalets & Campsites and then to Campsites (no clear direction or indication of the time required). It turned out to be a long (4+ km) curved badly maintained stong track with big stones requiring a 4x4 and taking more than 25 minutes to find our campsite (we were the only campers). The sites are far apart (good for privacy) but with poor signs to the various sites. As we wanted to have diner in the restaurant we had to return and had an excellent diner but had to return to the campsite in the dusk and too late to light up the donkey boiler etc.\nThe campsite offered a boiler, shower, toilet, braai, flush toilet, dustbin, wash basin and fire place. No electricity, no lights. Cars passing during the night. And of course baboons.\nNot our best camping experience in Botswana.\nOur advice: come early and take your time to find the campsite.",

  "text": "Exactly one year after the first time, we came here again since our year pass was coming to an end. This time we saw literally not one single mamal in the whole park! And again we couldn't believe that they mark SOME roads as 4x4 only. We drive a brand new Landrover and I can assure you you need a 4x4 for every single road in the park. And moreover they are so badly kept that you get scratches all over your car from branches and risk punctures at all the stony roads. And for what doing the trouble: there is nothing to see. We did hear the restaurant isn't bad but it was closed so we could not try that. But the \"park\" itself is rubish. Utterly rubish. Please note that I have written 2700 reviews here and there aren't many with a 1 dot note.....",

We didn't do any game drives as such as needed to set up our camp, but we did see quite a few animals just going to the camp site area! \nThe staff at reception were just so so friendly and helpful. we had to have our covid tests printed and they sorted for us, and also had a connection at the labs, as one of our tests hadn't come through, and they called them, after hours to assist us. They really went out of the way to help us.\n\nThe campsite was clean and rustic. lovely stopover if you need to stay in Gaborone.",

Even roads not indicated as 4x4 roads exclusively were effectively only good for 4x4, and it was a nice dry day. So bushy you cannot see an impala if it's 3 meters far... And we have driven all over Botswana so we can compare! We only saw 7 species of mammals and to drive yourself you need to buy a year permit of 700 pula.

I was told there was a watering hole near the restaurant and the animals came to it at sunset. This is NOT true.  The guide (Pinot) seemed fairly knowledgeable but there was just nothing to see.  which for all the animals that Pinot said that they had on property seems VERY unusual ",

  "text": "We arranged for an afternoon two hour game drive.  The disappointing aspect was the lack of animals that we were unable to see.  It was afternoon, it was hot and they dont turn up on order!  That said, we saw different types of antelope and warthog families with really cute babies.  The trip included what the driver referred to as an 'African massage'.  Basically the transportation and the terrain means it is a very shaky ride.  There was only our group of three on the drive so we had plenty of room and good interaction with the guide.  He really tried to find some animals for us to see.\n\nWe booked a taxi from the hotel to take us there and arranged a time for them to pick us up.  It only took about half an hour from the hotel each way so not much wasted time.  Overall it was good trip, lots of flora and fresh air and very inexpensive.",

However, it was well worth it, my guide pointed out animals and birds that I'd probably not have noticed, and was helpful and patient with me. I saw a giraffe, impalas, hippos (in the distance, admittedly), a fish-eagle, and various others. Because I had limited time I asked my guide that the trip be about an hour and a half, and she kept to that.",

  "text": "I visited this reserve whilst having a day off while working in Gaborone.  The reserve itself is only about 15 minutes out of town on the main route south of the city.   It is not a big place, but it does have a fair few animals in there.  If you are looking for the \"big Five\" you wont find them here, but you will find a lot of Impala, Kudu, Warthogs, Giraffe etc.  I went round the park on the back of a truck.  The tracks are pretty rough so be prepared to be knocked around a bit.  \n\nThe place was very dry, it having not rained for many months, but this made it easier to see the animals as there was not a lot of cover obstructing them.  \n\nI enjoyed my time there, got to see a fair bit of wildlife as well.  There is a reptile area, with snakes and tortoises that have been rescued or removed from danger,  on site.  I like snakes so it was great to see so many up close.  \n\nI finished the visit with lunch at the onsite restaurant.  overall it was a great way to spend half a day.  If in Gaborone and wondering what to do, then I suggest a quick drive south to Mokolodi",

  "text": "I visited Mokolodi Nature Reserve a week ago. The place itself is good but there was a group of people camping playing loud music all night long. Absolutely appalling. No guards, management or else shut them down or kick them off the camp. Absolutely awful. This carried on all night-long. When I went next morning to complain at reception the very kind staff told me that they had received a lot of complaints already. However these people still were within the Reserve. Shocking. I wrote an email of complaint and the CEO replied stating that this they do not permit this...but it went on for 24hrs, since I got to camp in the afternoon, throughout the night and next morning... APPALLING, annoying. Do not recommend the place for it seems to allow drunken parties with loud music. Won´t be returning EVER. Hope they actually do something to avoid these happenings and the place does not turn into a brothel. I am brutally honest. I am recommending the place for loud lousy alcohol & drugs parties, not for a nature experience.",

  "text": "With only a morning/afternoon to explore before our flight out of Gabs, our hotel concierge suggested Mokolodi.  He then made the call and reserved the Rhino trek for us at $65 per person.\n\nWe arranged a taxi to pick us up at 6:30am to make the 7:30 check-in time.  This gave us about 10 spare minutes.  Going rate is P400 ($40) each way.\n\nThe Rhino trek started on an open-air truck.  This was in June when in was winter in Botswana, and it was a little cold on the ride out.  We drove around for 30-45 minutes, stopping a few times as the guides found tracks and used the directional radio to try and find the Rhinos.  Eventually we dismounted the truck, and walked about 1-2 kilometers into the bush.  Definitely recommend hiking shoes and long pants.\n\nWe came up on the Rhino, and there's no describing being about 15 meters from such a huge creature, with no barriers or gates or fences.  Just a guide with a very flimsy looking rifle (maybe to shoot one of us so the rest get away?).\n\nThis is well worth a trip; it's really a once in a lifetime sort of thing, and a great way to see 1 of the big 5 if you don't have a lot of spare time to go deep into the bush, or fly north toward Maun or Kasane.",

  "text": "We had a free afternoon and decided to visit this game reserve.\nIts not anywhere in comparison to the big game reserves like Kruger but its worth the visit since there is not much to do in Gaborone.\nThe booking was done by our hotel but I am pretty sure they accept walk in.\nThe ride was a bit uncomfortable since they dont have paved roads.\nThey dont have elephants and lions in the reserve.\nWe saw a lot of impala and warthogs. We also saw a lone kudu and 3 rhinos.\nSnacks and cold drinks were provided during the 2 hour ride.\nIt was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon but if you expect it to be like the big parks then you will be dissapointed.",

  "text": "We probably should have trusted our guts (and the Trip Advisor reviews).  Mokolodi just isn’t worth the visit.  Fortunately, it doesn’t cost a lot so we weren’t out that much financially for such a disappointing time.  Since neither the website nor the brochures will tell you, it’s P150 per person for a 2-hour game drive (at time of writing, about $15US or $19CDN) It’s a shame, since they claim their goals are education and conservation...but I just can’t recommend it as a destination.\n\nThe pros:  the mostly outdoor restaurant is super cute, clean, reasonably priced and the food was tasty.  The service was friendly and efficient.\n\nThe cons:  (1) as so many other reviewers have mentioned- the lack of animals.  I completely understand that on any type of “safari “ or game drive, you’re at the mercy of circumstances.  But there should at least be signs of animals....tracks, dung.... strangely, not here.  It kind of makes you wonder.  In 2 hours we saw mere glimpses of 1 zebra, a few warthogs, and maybe 5 impala dashing away in the distance.  There was a giraffe eating leaves and almost completely hidden by the trees, although that fleeting and obscured view of gold & brown spots was probably the “highlight” of our excursion. There were 2 hippos almost completely submerged in a watering hole.  (Yes, I know....that’s what hippos do) There was next to no narration by the “guide”.  Nothing about the vegetation (since that’s really all we saw). Only on the handful of occasions we almost saw an animal did she speak up with a 30 second blurb - although we couldn’t hear her at the back of the vehicle anyway. To market this as a place offering game drives is really overselling it.\n\n(2) the vehicle- the vehicle you are driven around in for 2 hours  over extremely rocky, unmaintained trails has virtually no suspension.  It was bumpy beyond  belief.  You will be jostled and bounced and slammed around the entire time.  We weren’t expecting luxury but we certainly weren’t expecting this degree of discomfort.  Ladies, be sure to wear a tight sports bra to harness your bosom.  Honestly, I’m not kidding.  Your butt will also be sore by the time they finally let you off.  If you’re tall, you won’t be able to see out of the vehicle because the roll of the canopy roof hangs down and obscures your view.  On the bright side, see (1) above - no animals.  \n\nFortunately, we had done several beautiful, successful, photo-worthy, animal-filled and information-filled game drives elsewhere on our trip and the Mokolodi experience isn’t the one that will colour our vacation memories.\n\n(3) The gift shop - Sadly, they’re really missing the boat here.  Given the goals of the operation, I was prepared to drop some cash at a gift shop to pump some money into conservation efforts.  There was virtually nothing to choose from.  Some skilled attention to stocking appealing (or any) inventory would go a long way.\n\nThere are other experiences available at Mokolodi and I can’t comment on those.  (Bush braais, rhino tracking, giraffe tracking) Maybe they are better.  They likely can’t be worse.",
